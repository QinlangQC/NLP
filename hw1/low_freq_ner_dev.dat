West
Indian
all-rounder
Phil
Simmons
took
four
for
_DIGIT_
on
Friday
as
Leicestershire
beat
Somerset
by
an
innings
and
_DIGIT_
runs
in
two
days
to
take
over
at
the
head
of
the
county
championship
.

Their
stay
on
top
,
though
,
may
be
short-lived
as
title
rivals
Essex
,
Derbyshire
and
Surrey
all
closed
in
on
victory
while
Kent
made
up
for
lost
time
in
their
rain-affected
match
against
Nottinghamshire
.

After
bowling
Somerset
out
for
_DIGIT_
on
the
opening
morning
at
Grace
Road
,
Leicestershire
extended
their
first
innings
by
_DIGIT_
runs
before
being
bowled
out
for
_DIGIT_
with
England
discard
Andy
Caddick
taking
three
for
_DIGIT_
.

Trailing
by
_DIGIT_
,
Somerset
got
a
solid
start
to
their
second
innings
before
Simmons
stepped
in
to
bundle
them
out
for
_DIGIT_
.

Essex
,
however
,
look
certain
to
regain
their
top
spot
after
Nasser
Hussain
and
Peter
Such
gave
them
a
firm
grip
on
their
match
against
Yorkshire
at
Headingley
.

Hussain
,
considered
surplus
to
England
's
one-day
requirements
,
struck
_DIGIT_
,
his
first
championship
century
of
the
season
,
as
Essex
reached
_DIGIT_
and
took
a
first
innings
lead
of
_DIGIT_
.

By
the
close
Yorkshire
had
turned
that
into
a
37-run
advantage
but
off-spinner
Such
had
scuttled
their
hopes
,
taking
four
for
_DIGIT_
in
_DIGIT_
balls
and
leaving
them
hanging
on
_DIGIT_
for
five
and
praying
for
rain
.

At
the
Oval
,
Surrey
captain
Chris
Lewis
,
another
man
dumped
by
England
,
continued
to
silence
his
critics
as
he
followed
his
four
for
_DIGIT_
on
Thursday
with
_DIGIT_
not
out
on
Friday
in
the
match
against
Warwickshire
.

He
was
well
backed
by
England
hopeful
Mark
Butcher
who
made
_DIGIT_
as
Surrey
closed
on
_DIGIT_
for
seven
,
a
lead
of
_DIGIT_
.

Derbyshire
kept
up
the
hunt
for
their
first
championship
title
since
_DIGIT_
by
reducing
Worcestershire
to
_DIGIT_
for
five
in
their
second
innings
,
still
_DIGIT_
runs
away
from
avoiding
an
innings
defeat
.

After
the
frustration
of
seeing
the
opening
day
of
their
match
badly
affected
by
the
weather
,
Kent
stepped
up
a
gear
to
dismiss
Nottinghamshire
for
_DIGIT_
.

They
were
held
up
by
a
gritty
_DIGIT_
from
Paul
Johnson
but
ex-England
fast
bowler
Martin
McCague
took
four
for
_DIGIT_
.

By
stumps
Kent
had
reached
_DIGIT_
for
three
.

The
world
's
costliest
footballer
Alan
Shearer
was
named
as
the
new
England
captain
on
Friday
.

The
26-year-old
,
who
joined
Newcastle
for
_DIGIT_
million
pounds
sterling
(
$
23.4
million
)
,
takes
over
from
Tony
Adams
,
who
led
the
side
during
the
European
championship
in
June
,
and
former
captain
David
Platt
.

Adams
and
Platt
are
both
injured
and
will
miss
England
's
opening
World
Cup
qualifier
against
Moldova
on
Sunday
.

Shearer
takes
the
captaincy
on
a
trial
basis
,
but
new
coach
Glenn
Hoddle
said
he
saw
no
reason
why
the
former
Blackburn
and
Southampton
skipper
should
not
make
the
post
his
own
.

"
_CAP_
'm
sure
there
wo
n't
be
a
problem
,
_CAP_
'm
sure
Alan
is
the
man
for
the
job
,
"
Hoddle
said
.

"
There
were
three
or
four
people
who
could
have
done
it
but
when
_CAP_
spoke
to
Alan
he
was
up
for
it
and
really
wanted
it
.

"
In
four
days
it
's
very
difficult
to
come
to
a
_DIGIT_
percent
conclusion
about
something
like
this
...

but
he
knows
how
to
conduct
himself
,
his
team
mates
respect
him
and
he
knows
about
the
team
situation
even
though
he
plays
up
front
.
"

Shearer
's
Euro
_DIGIT_
striking
partner
Teddy
Sheringham
withdrew
from
the
squad
with
an
injury
on
Friday
.

He
will
probably
be
replaced
by
Shearer
's
Newcastle
team
mate
Les
Ferdinand
.

Rotor
Volgograd
must
play
their
next
home
game
behind
closed
doors
after
fans
hurled
bottles
and
stones
at
Dynamo
Moscow
players
during
a
1-0
home
defeat
on
Saturday
that
ended
Rotor
's
brief
spell

leaders
.

The
head
of
the
Russian
league
's
disciplinary
committee
,
Anatoly
Gorokhovsky
,
said
on
Friday
that
Rotor
would
play

_DIGIT_

The
club
,
who
put
Manchester
United
out
of
last
year
's

,
were

$
_DIGIT_
.

Despite
the
defeat
,
Rotor
are
well
placed
with
_DIGIT_
games
to
play
in
the
championship
.

Lying
three
points
behind

two

,
the

side
have
a
game
in
hand
over
the

Panamanian
boxing
legend
Roberto
"
Hands
of
Stone
"
Duran
climbs
into
the
ring
on
Saturday
in
another
age-defying
attempt
to
sustain
his
long
career
.

Duran
,
_DIGIT_
,
takes
on
little-known
Mexican
Ariel
Cruz
,
_DIGIT_
,
in
a
super
middleweight
non-title
bout
in
Panama
City
.

The
fight
,
Duran
's
first
on
home
soil
for
_DIGIT_
years
,
is
being
billed
here
as
the
"
Return
of
the
Legend
"
and
Duran
still
talks
as
if
he
was
in
his
prime
.

"
_CAP_
want
a
fifth
title
.

This
match
is
to
prepare
me
.

_CAP_
feel
good
.

_CAP_
'm
not
retiring
,
"
Duran
told
Reuters
.

But
those
close
to
the
boxer
acknowledge
that
the
man
who
has
won
championships
in
four
different
weight
classes
--
lightweight
,
welterweight
,
junior
middleweight
and
middleweight
--
is
drawing
close
to
the
end
of
his
career
.

"
Each
time
he
fights
,
he
's
on
the
last
frontier
of
his
career
.

If
he
loses
Saturday
,
it
could
devalue
his
position
as
one
of
the
world
's
great
boxers
,
"
Panamanian
Boxing
Association
President
Ramon
Manzanares
said
.

Duran
,
whose
97-12
record
spans
three
decades
,
hopes
a
win
in
the
10-round
bout
will
earn
him
a
rematch
against
Puerto
Rico
's
Hector
"
Macho
"
Camacho
.

Camacho
took
a
controversial
points
decision
against
the
Panamanian
in
Atlantic
City
in

in
a
title
fight

Andre
Agassi
escaped
disaster
on
Thursday
but
Wimbledon
finalist
MaliVai
Washington
and
Marcelo
Rios
were
not
so
fortunate
on
a
night
of
upsets
at
the
U.S.
Open
.

The
11th-seeded
Washington
fell
short
of
reprising
his
Wimbledon
miracle
comeback
as
he
lost
to
red-hot
wildcard
Alex
O'Brien
6-3
6-4
5-7
3-6
6-3
in
a
two
hour
_DIGIT_
minute
struggle
on
the
Stadium
court
.

Next
door
on
the
grandstand
,
10th
seed
Rios
lost
to
another
player
with
a
Wimbledon
connection
--
bad
boy
Jeff
Tarango
.

The
temperamental
left-hander
defeated
the
Chilean
6-4
4-6
7-6
6-2
.

The
day
programme
went
smoothly
although
sixth-seeded
former
champion
Agassi
had
to
wriggle
out
of
a
dangerous
3-6
0-4
hole
,
winning
_DIGIT_
of
the
last
_DIGIT_
games
against
India
's
Leander
Paes
.

But
the
night
belonged
to
the
upstarts
.

Washington
,
who
climbed
back
from
a
1-5
deficit
,
two
sets
down
in
the
third
set
against
Todd
Martin
in
the
Wimbledon
semifinals
,
looked
poised
for
another
sensational
comeback
.

O'Brien
,
a
winner
two
weeks
ago
in
New
Haven
for
his
first
pro
title
,
served
for
the
match
at
5-4
in
the
third
set
before
Washington
came
charging
back
.

"
_CAP_
just
kept
saying
to
myself
,
'
keep
giving
yourself
the
best
chance
to
win
,
keep
battling
,
maybe
something
will
happen
,
'
"
said
the
26-year-old
O'Brien
,
ranked
65th
.

"
_CAP_
kept
my
composure
and
_CAP_
was
proud
of
myself
for
that
--
usually
_CAP_
would
have
folded
up
the
tent
and
gone
home
.
"

The
hard-serving
O'Brien
,
a
former
U.S.
collegiate
national
champion
,
fired
up
_DIGIT_
aces
to
ultimately
subdue
the
never-say-die
Washington
.

The
fifth
set
stayed
on
serve
until
the
sixth
game
,
when
Washington
,
after
saving
one
break
point
with
a
forehand
winner
down
the
line
,
netted
a
backhand
to
give
O'Brien
a
4-2
lead
.

The
Texan
blasted
in
two
aces
to
hold
serve
at
5-2
and
then
converted
his
eighth
match
point
for
victory
when
Washington
found
the
net
with
another
backhand
from
40-0
.

"
You
just
kind
of
keep
fighting
and
you
keep
trying
to
make
him
play
a
little
bit
.

_CAP_
think
he
got
a
little
tight
at
a
couple
of
moments
,
"
said
Washington
.
"

But
_CAP_
think
he
served
pretty
well
when
he
had
to
.
"

Tarango
,
whose
Wimbledon
tantrum
two
years
ago
brought
him
a
$
_DIGIT_
fine
and
suspension
from
this
year
's
tournament
at
the
All-England
Club
,
argued
calls
and
taunted
fans
in
his
lively
two
hour
,
_DIGIT_
minute
tango
with
Rios
on
the
grandstand
.

_CAP_
boisterous
cheering
section
backed
the
distracted
Chilean
and
booed
the
lanky
American
,
who
ate
up
all
the
attention
.

"
_CAP_
'm
an
emotional
player
,
"
said
the
104th-ranked
Tarango
.
"

_CAP_
think
_CAP_
played
very
well
tonight
,
very
focused
.
"

The
match
turned
on
the
third-set
tiebreaker
,
which
the
American
won
7-5
much
to
the
dismay
of
the
spectators
.

"
_CAP_
love
the
crowd
if
they
boo
me
every
day
.

It
fires
me
up
,
makes
me
play
my
best
tennis
,
"
Tarango
said
.

"
_CAP_
played
some
of
my
best
tennis
in
college
when
fraternities
were
throwing
beer
on
me
.

If
tennis
was
like
that
every
day
,
_CAP_
think
everybody
wold
be
having
a
lot
more
fun
.
"

Rios
did
not
appreciate
Tarango
's
antics
.

"
He
's
always
complaining
too
much
,
"
said
Rios
.
"

But
_CAP_
think
it
's
not
that
.

_CAP_
think
_CAP_
played
really
bad
.

It
was
tough
to
play
at
night
.

Balls
were
going
really
fast
.

_CAP_
lost
too
many
points
that
_CAP_
never
lose
.

_CAP_
did
n't
play
my
tennis
.
"

"
_CAP_
do
n't
see
the
ball
like
_CAP_
see
during
the
day
.

_CAP_
play
an
American
so
that
's
why
_CAP_
play
at
night
.

_CAP_
did
n't
feel
good
on
the
court
.
"

At
the
end
of
the
match
,
Tarango
blew
sarcastic
kisses
to
the
crowd
,
then
jiggled
his
body
to
a
Rios
rooting
section
in
a
jeering
salute
.

"
_CAP_
support
their
enthusiasm
,
"
Tarango
said
about
the
fans
.
"

At
the
same
time
,
they
're
cheering
blatantly
against
me
.

After
_CAP_
won
_CAP_
figured
_CAP_
could
give
them
a
little
razzle-dazzle
.

Randall
Cunningham
,
the

rusher
as
a

and
one
of
the

athletic
players
ever
to

the
wonderful

me
throughout

"
Cunningham
said
.

"
Although
it
saddens
me
to
leave

_CAP_
am
looking
forward
to
spending
more
time
with
my
family

pursuing
other
interests
that

for

Randall

Jeffrey
Lurie
.
"

During
his
_DIGIT_
years
in
Philadelphia

Nolan
Henke
fired
a
nine-under-par
_DIGIT_
to
grab
a
two-shot
lead
after
the
opening
round
of
the
$
1.2
million
Greater
Milwaukee
Open
Thursday
as
20-year-old
Tiger
Woods
shot
_DIGIT_
in
his
professional
debut
.

Henke
stood
two
strokes
ahead
of
Bob
Estes
and
three
up
on
Billy
Andrade
,
Duffy
Waldorf
and
Jesper
Parnevik
.

Woods
,
who
turned
pro
Tuesday
after
winning
an
unprecedented
third
successive
U.S.
Amateur
Championship
,
almost
eagled
the
18th
hole
.

He
settled
for
a
birdie
and
a
four-under
opening
round
that
left
him
five
shots
off
the
pace
.

"
Yesterday
was
the
toughest
day
_CAP_
've
had
for
a
long
time
,
"
Woods
said
.
"

Today
,
_CAP_
got
to
play
golf
.
"

He
added
:
"
_CAP_
thought
_CAP_
got
off
off
to
a
great
start
.

It
was
a
perfect
start
.

_CAP_
'm
in
a
good
position
.
"

Henke
,
who
called
his
round
a
"
pleasant
surprise
,
"
finished
with
six
birdies
on
the
final
eight
holes
.

"
We
finally
got
things
going
in
the
right
direction
,
"
he
said
.
"

It
was
my
best
round
in
a
very
long
time
.

My
short
game
has
improved
since
_CAP_
've
had
to
use
it
so
often
.

That
's
always
been
the
worst
part
of
my
game
.

All
in
all
,
playing
bad
's
been
a
good
experience
.
"

Henke
,
who
came
within
one
shot
of
the
course
record
set
by
Andrew
Magee
during
Wednesday
's
pro-am
,
has
three
career
_CAP_
Tour
victories
,
but
none
since
the
_DIGIT_
BellSouth
Classic
.

Estes
,
whose
only
win
came
at
the
_DIGIT_
Texas
Open
and
whose
best
finish
this
year
was
a
third-place
tie
at
the
Nortel
Open
in
January
,
eagled
the
par-five
fourth
hole
and
added
five
birdies
to
grab
sole
possession
of
second
place
.

"
No
bogeys
on
the
card
,
"
he
noted
.
"

Sometimes
_CAP_
take
more
pride
in
that
.
"

Woods
was
among
a
group
of
_DIGIT_
players
at
four
under
,
including
_DIGIT_
champion
Billy
Mayfair
,
who
tied
for
second

week
's
World
Series
of
Golf
,
and
former
U.S.
Open
champ
Payne
Stewart
.

Defending
champion
Scott
Hoch
shot
a
three-under
_DIGIT_
and
was
six
strokes
back
.

Phil

,
the
only
four-time

American
Dennis
Mitchell
outclassed
Olympic
_DIGIT_
metres
champion
Donovan
Bailey
for
the
third
time
at
a
major
post-Games
meeting
in
front
of
the
most
experienced
sprinting
crowd
in
the
world
on
Friday
.

Watched
by
an
array
of
former
Olympic
sprint
champions
at
the
Berlin
grand
prix
meeting
,
Mitchell
made
a
brilliant
start
in
the
_DIGIT_
metres
and
held
off
Bailey
's
strong
finish
to
win
in
10.08
seconds
despite
cool
conditions
.

Bailey
,
who
set
a
world
record
of
9.84
on
his
way
to
victory
in
Atlanta
,
could
not
catch
his
American
rival
and
had
to
settle
for
third
in
a
tight
finish
.

Jamaica
's
Michael
Green
was
second
with
10.09
with
Bailey
finishing
in
10.13
.

Last
Friday
Mitchell
,
who
finished
fourth
at
the
Atlanta
Games
,
upstaged
a
trio
of
Olympic
champions
including
Bailey
to
win
the
_DIGIT_
in
Brussels
.

Earlier
this
month
he
also
beat
world
champion
Bailey
in
Zurich
.

Berlin
,
Brussels
and
Zurich
all
belong
to
the
most
lucrative
series
in
the
sport
,
the
Golden
Four
.

Among
the
crowd
on
Friday
were
Olympic
_DIGIT_
metres
champions
going
back
to
_DIGIT_
.

They
had
been
invited
to
the
meeting
to
watch
a
special
relay
to
mark
the
60th
anniversary
of
Jesse
Owens
's
four
gold
medals
at
the
_DIGIT_
Olympics
in
the
same
Berlin
stadium
.

"
Today
the
concentration
was
the
most
important
thing
for
me
,
"
Mitchell
said
.

Despite
the
coolish
conditions
American
Olympic
champion
Gail
Devers
looked
in
commanding
form
in
the
women
's
_DIGIT_
,
clocking
10.89
to
defeat
Jamaican
rival
Merlene
Ottey
,
who
was

_CAP_
came
down
heavily
on
Belgian
club
Standard
Liege
on
Friday
for
"
disgraceful
behaviour
"
in
an
Intertoto
final
match
against
Karlsruhe
of
Germany
.

The
Belgian
club
were
fined
_DIGIT_
Swiss
francs
(
$
_DIGIT_
)
for
unsporting
conduct
and
captain
Guy
Hellers
banned
for
seven
games
.

He
was
sent
off
for
insulting
the
referee
and
then
urged
his
team
mates
to
protest
.

Roberto
Bisconti
will
be
sidelined
for
six
Euro
ties
after
pushing
the
referee
in
the
back
as
he
protested
about
a
Karlsruhe
goal
,
while
Didier
Ernst
was
banned
for
four
matches
for
a
verbal
attack
soon
after
Bisconti
was
also
dismissed
.

Karlsruhe
won
the
August
_DIGIT_
match
3-1
thanks
to
two
late
goals
.

They
took
the
tie
3-2
on

will
both
take
part
in
a

competition
at

on

"

at

.

Atlanta

silver

winner
Edwards
has
called
on
other
leading
athletes
to
take
part
in
the
Sarajevo
meeting
--
a
goodwill
gesture
towards
Bosnia
as
it
recovers
from
the
war
in
the
Balkans
--
two
days
after
the
grand

final
in

.

Edwards
was
quoted
as
saying
:
"
What
type
of
character
do
we
show
by
going
to
the
_CAP_
Grand
Prix
Final
in
Milan
where
there
is
a
lot
of
money
to
make
but
refusing
to
make
the
trip
to
Sarajevo
as
a
humanitarian
gesture
?

Former
Italian
international
winger
Gianluigi
Lentini
,
transferred
to
Milan
in
_DIGIT_
for
what
was
believed
to
be
a
world
record
sum
,
has
been
loaned
to
serie
_CAP_
club
Atalanta
for
a
year
,
newspapers
reported
on
Friday
.

The
Gazzetta
dello
Sport
said
the
deal
would
cost
Atalanta
around
$
_DIGIT_
.

Lentini
,
_DIGIT_
,
joined
Milan
from
Torino
in
a
$
_DIGIT_
million
deal
that
many
have
speculated
involved
far
more
money
changing
hands
and
which
has
subsequently
been
investigated
by
magistrates
for
alleged
financial
irregularities
.

The
player
suffered
severe
head
injuries
in
a
near-fatal
car
crash
the
following
year
and
has
since
struggled
to
regain
the
form
that
made
him
a
hero
in
Turin
.

The
move
to
Bergamo-based
Atalanta
reunites
Lentini

who
fell
out
with
ex-Milan
coach
Fabio
Capello
last
season
,

Romanian
listed
state
engineer
Comelf
said
it
almost
doubled
six-month
output
,
with
net
profit
rising
by
_DIGIT_
percent
to
1.069
billion
lei
.

But
the
company
complained
inflation
and
the
artificially
high
rate
of
the
leu
cut
profit
margins
on
exports
,
keeping
profits
well
below
its
forecast
of
1.4
billion
lei
.

Comelf
's
six-month
output
rose
to
_DIGIT_
tonnes
of
equipment
from
_DIGIT_
tonnes
in
the
equivalent
period
in
_DIGIT_
,
the
company
report
to
the
Bucharest
stock
exchange
showed
.

Comelf
,
based
in
the
central
Transylvanian
town
of
Bistrita
,
manufactures
water
purification
equipment
,
machinery
for
the
thermal
power
sector
and
other
equipment
.

"
In
the
first
six
months
of
_DIGIT_
we
concentrated
on
increasing
the
volume
of
our
output
and
exports
in
particular
and
improving
the
quality
of
our
products
,
"
the
report
said
.

From
January
to
June
Comelf
exported
_DIGIT_
percent
of
its
output
,
up
from
37.3
percent
in
the
same
period
last
year
.

The
company
said
higher
than
anticipated
inflation
and
rising
raw
materials
and
wage
costs
also
hit
profits
.

Year-on-year
inflation
,
initially
estimated
at
_DIGIT_
percent
in
December
,
was
33.8
percent
in
June
,
higher
than
a
revised
end-year
forecast
of
_DIGIT_
percent
.

The
_DIGIT_
month
figure
quickened
to
40.3
percent
in
July
.

The
leu
currency
has
slipped
only
gradually
this
year
,
and
is
currently
quoted
at
an
official
rate
of
_DIGIT_
to
the
dollar
,
well
below
the
_DIGIT_
retail
price
that
exporters
say
is
more
realistic
.

a

U.S.

futures
end
lower
,
shaken
by
Chicago
_CAP_
.

_CAP_
1996-08-30

U.S.
debt
futures
finished
a
shortened
pre-holiday
session
sharply
lower
,
as
the
markets
were
shaken
by
a
stronger
than
expected
rise
in
the
August
National
Association
of
Purchasing
Management
(
_CAP_
)
index
for
the
Chicago
area
,
traders
and
analysts
said
.

The
August
Chicago
_CAP_
rose
8.8
points
to
60.0
,
its
highest
level
since
62.6
in
February
_DIGIT_
and
the
largest
monthly
rise
since
December
_DIGIT_
.

Primary
dealers
immediately
sold
Eurodollar
and
bond
futures
,
after
the
market
on
average
was
expecting
the
index
to
rise
marginally
to
51.9
from
July
's
51.2
.

Traders
also
said
Japanese
investors
were
unwinding
long
Eurodollar
futures
/
short
swaps
,
and
that
heavy
put
buying
helped
pressure
Eurodollars
to
lower
levels
before
the
close
.

One
U.S.
firm
bought
_DIGIT_
September
_DIGIT_
mid-curve
put
options
at
a
strike
price
of
93.25
to
93.30
in
the
last
two
sessions
,
while
a
French
firm
bought
_DIGIT_
September
93.30
to
93.32
put
spreads
.

"
Even
before
the
data
came
out
,
we
were
seeing
put
buying
,
"
one
floor
trader
said
.

Meanwhile
,
funds
were
reportedly
good
sellers
of
five-year
notes
.

Rumors
circulated
that
the
Federal
Reserve
was
buying
five-year
notes
,
and
that
a
renowned
hedge
fund
manager
was
buying
10-year
notes
in
the
cash
markets
.

However
,
December
T-bonds
ended
below
a
major
trendline
level
at
106-26/32
,
as
the
yield
in
the
cash
bond
market
set
its
highest
monthly
close
since
April
_DIGIT_
at
7.12
percent
,
one
analyst
said
.

December
bonds
blew
through
the
July
_DIGIT_
low
of
107-06/32
,
even
though
conditions
were
slightly
oversold
,
traders
said
.

The
December
calendar
spread
continued
to
widen
,
also
reflecting
the
market
's
fear
of
rising
inflation
.

While
the
market
continues
to
price-in
higher
U.S.
interest
rates
,
there
was
little
conviction
to
the
theory
that
the
Federal
Reserve
would
tighten
rates
before
the
next
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
meeting
on
September
_DIGIT_
.

Federal
Reserve
governor
Lawrence
Lindsey
,
speaking
on
U.S.
cable
television
network
_CAP_
,
said
the
U.S.
economy
appears
on
balance
to
be
a
bit
strong
,
adding
the
central
bank
would
not
curb
growth
provided
inflation
remains
in
check
.

Earlier
in
the
day
,
Fed
chairman
Alan
Greenspan
said
at
the
annual
Jackson
Hole
symposium
that
the
goal
of
price
stability
is
within
reach
for
major
nations
.

Traders
said
the
Fed
's
decision
to
adopt
a
tightening
bias
at
the
July
_CAP_
meeting
has
cast
more
focus
on
every
piece
of
U.S.
economic
news
.

"
The
Fed
's
stance
has
really
sensitized
us
to
all
this
data
,
"
one
analyst
said
.
"

The
revisions
to
_CAP_
,
for
example
,
may
not
have
attracted
a
lot
of
attention
.

some

Family-controlled
Douglas

"

He
added

have
been
asked
to
stay
on
with
Magna
after
the
merger
,
though
their

Douglas

Iraqi
captors

charged

1996-08-30

Seven
Iraqis
who
seized
a
Sudanese
airliner
with
_DIGIT_
people
aboard
and
forced
it
to
fly
to
London
were
on
Friday
charged
with
hijack
,
ending
speculation
that
they
might
be
offered
immediate
asylum
in
Britain
.

Police
said
the
seven
men
,
who
freed
all
their
hostages
after
the
plane
landed
at
Stansted
airport
on
Tuesday
and
then
appealed
for
asylum
,
would
appear
in
court
on
Saturday
.

The
Iraqis
claimed
they
were
"
ordinary
people
persecuted
by
the
regime
of
Saddam
(
Hussein
)
"
but
interior
ministry
officials
had
consistently
said
it
was
likely
the
seven
would
be
charged
with
hijack
before
any
plea
for
asylum
was
considered
.

Under
English
law
the
maximum
sentence
for
hijack
is
life
imprisonment
,
but
there
has
been
widespread
speculation
that
the
seven
will
receive
lesser
sentences
and
then
be
allowed
to
stay
rather
than
being
sent
back
to
Iraq
.

The
hijack
began
on
Monday
when
an
Amman-bound
plane
was
taken
over
shortly
after
it
took
off
from
Khartoum
.

The
hijackers
threatened
to
blow
it
up
during
a
refuelling
stop
in
Cyprus
unless
they
were
taken
to
London
.

After
a
search
of
the
aircraft
following
the
hijackers
'
surrender
,
police
found
only
knives
and
fake
explosives

Former
world
heavyweight
champion
Frank
Bruno
has
quit
the
ring
on
medical
advice
,
Britain
's
Sun
newspaper
reported
on
Friday
.

An
eye
specialist
told
the
35-year-old
Bruno
that
he
could
be
blinded
in
one
eye
if
he
boxed
again
,
the
newspaper
said
.

The
Briton
,
who
lost
his
World
Boxing
Council
(
_CAP_
)
title
to
Mike
Tyson
in
March
,
said
:
"
_CAP_

as
soon

told
me
and
it
still
has
n't
really
sunk
in

_CAP_
never
wanted

end
like
this
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
_CAP_
'm
glad
_CAP_
had
a
good
innings
.
"

Bruno
,
for
years
one
of
Britain
's
most
popular
sportsmen
,
had
hoped
to
have
another
shot
at
the
world
title
and
had
been
in
training
until
a
routine
eye
test
on
Monday
highlighted
a
problem
with
his
right
eye
.

Professor
David
McLeod
,
who
examined
Bruno
,
told
the
Sun
:
"
There
is
a
risk
he
could
be
blinded
in
the
eye
if
he
steps
into
the
ring
again
.

He
is
in
danger
of
getting
a
retinal
detachment
and
there
is
no
point
in
exposing
himself
to
that
.
"

Bruno
lost
three
world
title
fights
before
finally
landing
the
crown
by
beating
American
Oliver
McCall
in
a
unanimous
points
decision
at
Wembley
in
September
_DIGIT_
.

He
was
only
the
third
Briton
ever
to
hold
a
world
heavyweight
title
.

But
Bruno
lost
the
title
on
his
first
defence
when
he
fought
American
Tyson
in
Las
Vegas
.

Bruno
suffered
a
cut
eye
in
the
opening
round
and
the
referee
stopped
the
fight
in
the
third
as
the
Briton
crumbled
under

punches

_CAP_
senior
Belarus
politician
accused
President
Alexander
Lukashenko
on
Friday
of
attempting
to
set
up
a
dictatorship
in
the
former
Soviet
republic
.

The
speaker
of
the
Belarus
parliament
,
Semyon
Sharetsky
,
told
Reuters
that
a
draft
constitution
,
due
to
be
put
to
a
national
referendum
on
November
_DIGIT_
,
would
dangerously
increase
the
powers
of
the
ruler
.

"
The
world
community
should
not
be
indifferent
to
the
fact
that
President
Lukashenko
,
who
leads
this
European
state
of
_DIGIT_
million
people
,
is
trying
to
establish
a
dictatorship
with
his
new
constitution
,
"
Sharetsky
said
.

The
new
constitution
calls
for
a
two-chamber
parliament
with
a
110-seat
majority-elected
house
of
representatives
and
a
regionally-represented
senate
with
a
third
of
its
members
named
by
the
president
.

Lukashenko
's
aides
shrugged
off
Sharetsky
's
charge
.
"

If
there
was
a
dictatorship
they
would
n't
have
the
right
to
say
things
like
this
,
"
Sergei
Posukhov
,
Lukashenko
's
political
adviser
,
told
Reuters
.

"
The
people
have
asked
us
to
establish
order
and
that
's
our
main
aim
.
"

Lukashenko
,
_DIGIT_
,
won
presidential
polls
in
_DIGIT_
on
promises
to
restore
order
,
fight
corruption
and
repair
the
strong
links
with
Russia
that
were
disrupted
by
the
collapse
of
the
Soviet
Union
.

But
during
his
period
in
office
he
has
battled
against
nationalist
opponents
,
trade
unions
and
parliament
and
Sharetsky
said
the
current
parliament
was
ready
to
try
to
impeach
him
.

"
This
constitution
,
which
has
been
prepared
in
secret
,
aims
to
gather
all
power
in
one
man
's
hands
,
"
he
said
.
"

We
should
not
be
fooled
by
his
quasi-democratic
rhetoric
and
his
methods
,
like
this
referendum
.
"

Lukashenko
signed
a
pact
with
Moscow
in
April
to
create
a
strong
economic
and
political
union
which
he
believes
could
grow
into
a
federation
.

But
nationalist
groups
,
scared
by
the
prospect
of
renewed
Moscow
domination
and
Russia
's
backing
for
Lukashenko
,
protested
against
the
deal
.

Lukashenko
responded
by
cracking
down
on
the
nationalist
opposition
and
jailing
nearly
_DIGIT_
people
for
taking
part
in
demonstrations
against
the
pact
.

The
United
States
last
week
granted
political
asylum
to
two
opposition
leaders
,
Zenon
Poznyak
and
Sergei
Naumchik

Tajik
government
troops
now
control
of
the
strategically
vital
town
of
Tavildara
after
driving
out
Islamic
rebels
,
but
sporadic
gunfire
still
echoed
in
the
nearby
Pamir
mountains
on
Friday
.

The
commander-in-chief
of
Tajikistan
's
armed
forces
,
Major-General
Nikolai
Sherbatov
,
took
a
group
of
journalists
by
helicopter
to
the
remote
,
and
now
devastated
,
town
to
show
that
his
forces
held
it
.

He
said
his
troops
took
Tavildara
without
casualties
on
August
_DIGIT_
,
but
the
crack
of
sniper
and
machinegun
fire
revealed
the
presence
of
opposition
fighters
in
the
surrounding
mountains
.

Sherbatov
said
the
rebels
were
located
about
three
km
(
two
miles
)
east
of
Tavildara
around
the
village
of
Layron
.

Tavildara
,
_DIGIT_
km
(
_DIGIT_
miles
)
east
of
the
capital
Dushanbe
,
was
in
ruins
.

Shells
had
smashed
roofs
and
windows
and
empty
shell
cases
littered
the
streets
.

The
town
straddles
a
strategically
important
road
linking
government
and
rebel-held
territory
and
has
fallen
succesively
to
both
sides
in
a
bloody
tug-of-war
which
began
last
February
.

Tajikistan
,
which
borders
Afghanistan
and
China
,
has
been
split
by
a
dragging
four-year
conflict
after
a
civil
war
between
communists
and
a
frail
coalition
of
Islamic
and
liberal
groups
.

Tens
of
thousands
of
people
have
been
killed
and
many
more
have
been
displaced
in
the
fighting
,
which
breached
a
shaky
United
Nations-sponsored
ceasefire
.

Tavildara
is
now
apparently
inhabited
only
by
a
few
old
men
,
women
and
their
grubby
,
barefoot
children
.

Fruit
remained
on
the
trees
as
there
was
no
one
to
pick
it
.

"
Help
me
,
help
me
,
"
said
a
chorus
of
women
begging
soldiers
for
food
.

The
town
's
school
and
a
shop
doubling
as
a
warehouse
for
humanitarian
aid
were
destroyed
in
the
fighting
.

"
We
had
to
build
our
own
earth
shelters
to
survive
the
fighting
,
"
said
Rajab
Adinayev
,
a
bearded
elderly
Tajik
in
a
long
white
shirt
.

Although
shy
in
front
of
the
government
soldiers
,
several
inhabitants
accused
government
forces
of
widespread
looting
of
homes
and
livestock
.

They
also
said
rebel
fighters
had
looted
medicines
from
the
local
hospital
.

One
elderly
man
,
who
declined
to
give
his
name
,
said
two
of
his
sons
were
now
refugees
in
Moscow
and
the
other
two
had
left
to
fight
for
the
opposition
.

He
also
said
government
soldiers
had
raped
the
wife
of
one
of
his
sons
.
"

It
's
not
important
who
holds
this
town
,
we
just
need
to
stop
the
war
,
"
he
said
.

Naina
Yeltsin

Earlier
Russian

said
Yeltsin

a

Yeltsin

travelled
from

he

as
a

,
down
from
10.3

in
the

,
with
the
bulk
of
this

attributable
to
the

Far

thumped
foreheads
in
frustration
at
the
market
's
foot-dragging
this
week
and
forecast
on
Friday
that
next

would
not
be
much
better
.

The
Southeast
Asian
gold
market
was
more
or
less
a
photo-fit
picture
of
the
previous
week
's
position
with
activity
slow
and
bullion
prices
trapped
in
a
well-worn
range
awaiting
a
seasonal
upturn
in
demand
and
prices
into
the

for

with

premiums
also
steady
at

.

Singapore
dealers
said
they
were
concerned
that
there
had
been
a
marked
revival
in
offers
to
sell
gold
by
South
Korean
traders
,
following
the
distress
sales
of
recent
months
after
the
Seoul
government
's
crackdown
on

trade
.

"
_CAP_
was
shocked
to
see
these

coming
in
again
,
though
there
's
been
no

dread
to
think
what
will
happen

one

said
.

Continued
dishoarding

of
the

But
some

have
begun
to
show
their
discontent
in
the

which
has

of
militant

.

Tripoli-based

Twilight
zone
for
Wall
Street
as
political
race
heats
up
.

For
Wall
Street
,
this
is
the
season
to
be
cautious
as
the
presidential
contest
puts
the
stock
market
in
the
twilight
zone
.

President
Clinton
,
Bob
Dole
and
Ross
Perot
are
hitting
the
road
now
that
the
partying
is
over
,
and
people
who
have
billions
of
dollars
invested
in
stocks
were
bracing
for
political
promises
that
could
have
an
impact
on
their
wealth
.

Analysts
believe
that
the
candidates
will
add
to
the
market
's
list
of
uncertainties
,
which
already
includes
the
question
of
whether
the
Federal
Reserve
will
raise
interest
rates
to
cool
economic
growth
.

They
say
the
politicians
will
need
to
promote
legislation
that
helps
the
economy
without
scaring
the
socks
off
financial
markets
.

"
The
worst
thing
that
could
happen
for
financial
markets
is
that
if
Clinton
and
Dole
start
to
trade
shots
in
the
middle
of
the
ring
with
one-upmanship
,
"
said
Hugh
Johnson
,
chief
investment
officer
at
First
Albany
Corp.
"
That
's
when
Wall
Street
will
need
to
worry
.
"

He
said
that
the
bond
market
would
be
the
first
to
react
if
the
"
bidding
"
intensifies
and
stocks
would
quickly
drop
as
interest
rates
rise
.

"
_CAP_
do
n't
think
it
would
imply
the
collapse
of
the
stock
market
,
unless
the
rise
in
rates
touches
off
a
dynamic
within
the
market
,
which
would
include
selling
by
portfolio
managers
,
redemptions
by
individuals
of
mutual
funds
that
would
,
in
turn
,
pressure
the
portfolio
managers
to
sell
even
more
stock
.
"

This
week
,
the
market
weighed
Dole
's
proposal
to
lower
federal
income
taxes
by
_DIGIT_
percent
across
the
board
,
a
package
that
carries
a
price
tag
of
$
_DIGIT_
billion
.

Clinton
proposes
an
$
8.4
billion
re-election
agenda
that
would
spare
most
home-sellers
from
capital
gains
taxes
and
give
employers
tax
incentives
to
hire
people
off
the
welfare
rolls
.

Clinton
claims
Dole
's
plan
would
increase
the
deficit
,
while
the
White
House
said
some
corporate
taxes
would
be
raised
to
offset
the
cost
of
the
president
's
plan
.

The
experts
said
there
are
some
unusual
risks
for
the
market
from
this
year
's
political
season
because
the
rush
to
promise
tax
cuts
to
win
votes
could
upset
Wall
Street
's
expectations
that
Washington
will
balance
the
budget
.

"
The
stock
market
will
have
to
edit
the
promises
and
then
do
a
probability
study
on
those
edited
promises
,
"
said
John
Geraghty
at
the
consulting
firm
North
American
Equity
Services
.

During
the
past
four
presidential
elections
,
the
candidate
that
has
favoured
tax
cuts
has
won
.

Ronald
Reagan
's
tax
cut
won
him
a
second
four-year
term
in
the
White
House
in
_DIGIT_
,
while
Democrat
Walter
Mondale
,
who
promised
higher
taxes
,
lost
.

George
Bush
became
president
in
_DIGIT_
on
his
no-new-tax
campaign
and
Clinton
won
in
_DIGIT_
with
a
promise
to
fatten
workers
'
paychecks
.

The
trick
,
they
said
,
will
be
for
the
candidates
to
continue
to
convince
Wall
Street
that
the
Treasury
's
30-year
bond
--
the
most
closely-watched
interest
rate
--
will
fall
to
between
_DIGIT_
percent
and
_DIGIT_
percent
by
the
end
of
the
decade
.

Johnson
said
that
long-term
interest
rates
have
already
been
spooked
by
the
election
.

The
long-term
bond
jumped
this
week
to
7.13
percent
after
starting
the
year
at
5.95
percent
.

The
surge
of
buying
in
stocks
during
the
last
two
years
has
come
amid
an
environment
of
low
interest
rates
,
which
has
boosted
corporate
profits
.

But
the
market
stalled
this
summer
after
the
Dow
Jones
industrial
average
set
a
record
high
of
5,778.00
points
on
May
_DIGIT_
.

"
The
market
does
n't
seem
to
be
able
to
make
new
highs
and
it
has
been
back
and
forth
in
a
fairly
horizontal
mode
which
looks
like
a
holding
pattern
,
"
said
Geraghty
.

He
said
the
market
reflects
the
political
uncertainty
,
now
that
Dole
has
sharply
narrowed
the
gap
with
Clinton
in
the
polls
.

Geraghty
said
that
the
one
thing
that
could
completely
turn
the
election
around
are
new
findings
in
the
Whitewater
scandal
that
would
damage
the
Clintons
.

"
Stocks
are
on
a
delicate
edge
because
if
something
happens
that
looks
like
it
could
upset
the
presidency
,
it
could
throw
the
political
and
,
to
some
extent
the
economic
,
process
into
chaos
,
"
Geraghty
said
.

Right
now
,
Wall
Street
is
pondering
the
candidates
.

"
We
have
an
election
where
there
are
so
many
unknown
variables
that
most
people
will
probably
want
to
hold
fire
,
and
even
take
the
chance
that
they
will
have
to
pay
higher
prices
for
stocks
after
the
November
election
,
than
take
the
risk
that
a
shock
to
the
system
will
hurt
the
stock
market
,
"
Geraghty
said
.

On
Friday
,
the
Dow
Jones
index
closed
down
31.44
points
at

Factory
orders
rose
in
July
and
manufacturing
surged
in
the
Midwest
in
August
,
reports
said
Friday
,
sparking
worries
about
inflation
that
battered
financial
markets
for
a
second
straight
day
.

The
Commerce
Department
said
orders
for
manufactured
goods
climbed
1.8
percent
in
July
to
a
seasonally
adjusted
$
317.6
billion
--
nearly
twice
the
increase
that
had
been
expected
.

Shipments
of
everything
from
new
cars
to
food
items
rose
,
as
did
order
backlogs
,
in
a
sign
that
the

in

would
continue
in
coming
months
.

_CAP_

from

underlined
the

in

as
the
group
's
barometer
of
manufacturing
in

jumped
to
_DIGIT_
in
August
from
51.2
in
July
.

_CAP_
reading
above
_DIGIT_
indicates
growth
in
manufacturing
.

While
production
and
orders
rose
at
Midwest
area
businesses
,
the
prices
they
paid
for
goods
used
in
manufacturing
remained
well
in
check
.

Analysts
said
the
reports
implied
the
economy
was
not
slowing
down
in
the
third
quarter
after
a
burst
of
growth
in
the
spring
,
and
that
the
lull
in
late
June
and
July
was
more
temporary
than
Federal
Reserve
policy-makers
had
wanted
.

"
It
appears
that
August
is
showing
an
economy
again
reversing
course
and
is
not
moving
onto
a
significantly
slower
track
at
this
point
,
"
said
economist
Lynn
Reaser
of
Barnett
Banks
Inc.
in
Jacksonville
,
Fla
.

The
reports
fanned
worries
on
Wall
Street
that
the
Fed
,
the
nation
's
central
bank
,
would
raise
rates
next
month
in
a
bid
to
ward
off
inflation
,
driving
stock
and
bond
prices
sharply
lower
for
a
second
day
running
.

The
30-year
Treasury
fell
almost
a
point
,
raising
its
yield
,
which
moves
in
the
opposite
direction
from
the
price
,
to
7.12
percent
from
7.04
percent
late
Thursday
.

The
Dow
Jones
industrial
average
fell
31.44
points
to
5,616.21
after
a
64.73-point
decline
Thursday
.

_CAP_
third
report
from
the
Commerce
Department
,
on
July
personal
income
and
spending
,
pointed
to
a
potential
slowdown
in
consumer
spending
that
some
analysts
said
may
help
moderate
growth
in
the
second
half
.

It
showed
spending
rose
only
0.2
percent
last
month
to
a
seasonally
adjusted
annual
rate
of
$
5.15
trillion
after
dropping
a
revised
0.4
percent
in
June
.

Incomes
from
wages
,
salaries
and
all
other
sources
gained
0.1
percent
to
a
rate
of
$
6.47
trillion
after
a
0.9
percent
jump
in
June
.

July
's
slight
gain
in
incomes
was
the
weakest
in
six
months
,
since
January
when
they
were
flat
.

Economist
Joel
Naroff
of
First
Union
bank
in
Philadelphia
said
consumer
spending
,
which
fuels
two-thirds
of
the
nation
's
economy
,
may
be
much
slower
in
the
third
quarter
than
in
the
first
half
,
which
should
slow
economic
growth
.

"
The
_CAP_
(
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
)
has
been
forecasting
a
slowing
in
economic
activity
and
moderating
household
demand
will
have
a
large
impact
on
overall
economic
growth
,
"
Naroff
said
in
a
written
comment
.

The
policy-making
_CAP_
is
to
meet
on
Sept
.

_DIGIT_
to
plot
interest-rate
strategy
.

It
already
has
adopted
a
bias
toward
raising
rates
to
keep
a
lid
on
wage
and
price
rises
and
help
sustain
the
5-1
/
2-year-old
economic
expansion
.

In
an
interview
on
the
cable
television
network
_CAP_
Friday
,
Federal
Reserve
Governor
Lawrence
Lindsey
said
there
still
were
"
mixed
signals
"
about
the
economy
's
direction
.

"
_CAP_
think
that
,
on
balance
,
it
is
looking
a
little
bit
on
the
strong
side
,
"
Lindsey
said
.

He
added
that
with
expansion
as
solid
as
it
is
and
with
unemployment
so
low
"
the
greater
risks
are
clearly
that
we
might
see
some
overheating
.
"

While
July
consumer
spending
rose
only
slightly
,
there
were
ample
indications
that
consumers
remained
confident
.

The
University
of
Michigan
's
August
index
of
consumer
sentiment
,
made
available
on
Friday
to
paying
subscribers
,
rose
to
95.3
from
94.7
in
July
.

Reaser
said
strong
consumer
confidence
coupled
with
relatively
lean
inventories
were
providing
manufacturers
with
a
reason
to
gear
up
production
.

"
The
economy
is
not
going
to
be
expanding
at
the
4.8
percent
(
annual
)
rate
that
we
had
in
the
second
quarter
but
it
is
likely
to
keep
expanding
in
the
_DIGIT_
percent
range
,
"
she
said
,
above
the
_DIGIT_
percent
to
2-1/4
percent
that
the
Fed
considers
to
be
non-inflationary
.

Mexican
avocados
not
expected
in
U.S
.

Maggie
McNeil

_CAP_
1996-08-30

U.S.
Agriculture
Department
officials
said
Friday
that
Mexican
avocados
--
which
are
restricted
from
entering
the
continental
United
States
--
will
not
likely
be
entering
U.S.
markets
any
time
soon
,
even
if
the
controversial
ban
were
lifted
today
.

"
The
opportunity
to
import
(
Mexican
avocados
)
probably
wo
n't
become
possible
for
another
year
,
"
said
Paul
Drazek
,
senior
trade
advisor
to
Agriculture
Secretary
Dan
Glickman
.

"
We
could
lift
the
ban
tomorrow
,
but
that
would
not
mean
anything
immediately
,
"
said
Drazek
.
"

We
probably
would
not
see
avacados
come
in
until
next
season
,
next
November
.
"

The
Agriculture
Department
proposed
more
than
a
year
ago
to
significantly
ease
an
82-year
ban
on
Mexican
avocados
.

Under
the
administration
's
proposal
,
the
borders
to
the
Mexican
produce
would
be
opened
into
_DIGIT_
Northern
and
Northeastern
states
from
November
through
February
.

The
plan
has
raised
a
storm
of
protest
from
U.S.
avocado
growers
,
who
are
largely
concentrated
in
California
.

California
growers
have
charged
that
removing
the
restrictions
,
even
on
a
limited
basis
,
would
endanger
the
$
_DIGIT_
billion
U.S.
industry
if
potentially
harmful
Mexican
insects
were
brought
into
the
country
along
with
the
avocados
.

Mexican
officials
contend
that
there
is
no
scientific
basis
for
the
ban
,
and
that
it
is
illegal
under
international
trading
rules
of
the
World
Trade
Organisation
.

Proponents
of
the
plan
discount
the
worries
of
the
U.S.
growers
and
say
the
plan
has
enough
safeguards
built
into
it
to
eliminate
any
significant
threat
to
American
producers
.

Under
the
proposal
,
only
imports
of
export-quality
avocados
growing
in
approved
orchards
in
Michoacan
,
Mexico
,
the
country
's
main
avocado
area
,
would
be
allowed
.

Mexican
growers
and
distributors
would
have
to
abide
by
strict
rules
established
by
the
Mexican
and
U.S.
agriculture
agencies
.

The
California
Avocado
Commission
--
which
has
spearheaded
the
opposition
to
lifting
the
ban
--
said
new
data
the
group
submitted
to
the
Agriculture
Department
last
spring
shows
the
department
underestimated
the
pest
problem
in
Mexico
and
have
urged
that
the
agency
reopen
its
study
of
the
issue
.

The
administration
is
still
studying
the
new
data
,
and
officials
have
said
that
if
experts
think
the
information
is
significant
,
the
agency
could
reopen
its
investigation
.

But
U.S.
avocado
industry
sources
said
that
while
they
may
have
delayed
the
plan
for
a
while
,
they
ultimately
do
not
expect
the
administration
to
change
its
position
.

"
From
a
common-sense
view
,
the
department
should
reconsider
this
plan
,
but
due
to
politics
they
will
probably
go
ahead
with
this
,
"
said
Tom
Bellamore
of
the
California
avocado
group
.

Administration
officials
said
they
want
to
get
the
issue
resolved
as
quickly
as
possible
,
but
said
there
is
no
timetable
they
are
working
under
.

"
It
's
a
very
complicated
issue
,
"
said
the
Agriculture
Department
's
Drazek
.
"

We
'll
get
it
resolved
as
quickly
as
we
can
,
based
on
the
best
available
science
.

U.S.
Cardinal
Bernardin
says
has
terminal
cancer
.

_CAP_
1996-08-30

Chicago
Cardinal
Joseph
Bernardin
,
head
of
the
second-largest
U.S.
Roman
Catholic
archdiocese
,
said
on
Friday
his
doctors
had
diagnosed
him
as
having
liver
cancer
and
he
had
a
year
or
less
to
live
.

Bernardin
,
_DIGIT_
,
underwent
extensive
surgery
for
pancreatic
cancer
in
June
_DIGIT_
followed
by
months
of
chemotherapy
,
which
he
said
made
him
more
aware
of
his
own
vulnerabilities
and
the
need
to
minister
to
the
sick
.

"
On
Wednesday
,
examinations
indicated
that
the
cancer
has
returned
,
this
time
in
the
liver
.

_CAP_
am
told
that
it
is
terminal
and
that
my
life
expectancy
is
one
year
or
less
,
"
a
composed
Bernardin
told
a
news
conference
.

In
_DIGIT_
years
as
Chicago
's
archbishop
,
he
built
a
prayerful
,
saintly
image
and
was
deeply
involved
in
world
church
issues
and
publicly
committed
to
rooting
out
abuses
by
clergy
.

"
_CAP_
have
been
assured
that
_CAP_
still
have
some
quality
time
left
,
"
he
said
,
saying
he
would
undergo
a
new
form
of
chemotherapy
but
his
doctors
have
told
him
there
was
only
a
slim
chance
of
a
cure
and
the
liver
cancer
was
inoperable
.

"
It
's
not
going
to
be
easy
to
say
goodbye
to
everybody
.

Death
does
have
some
sad
dimensions
to
it
but
_CAP_
am
a
man
of
faith
,
"
he
said
.
"

Death
is
a
natural
phenomenom
.
"

He
said
he
would
"
serve
until
the
end
"
as
cardinal
.

Pancreatic
cancer
is
among
the
most
deadly
forms
of
the
disease
,
although
Bernardin
's
case
was
caught
early
.

Surgeons
removed
a
cancerous
kidney
,
parts
of
his
pancreas
and
stomach
,
small
intestine
,
bile
duct
and
surrounding
tissues
.

He
made
a
rapid
recovery
and
resumed
most
of
his
duties
,
but
then
developed
a
deteriorating
condition
in
his
spine
that
caused
him
great
pain
and
shortened
his
height
by
several
inches
.

He
was
scheduled
to
undergo
back
surgery
next
month
,
but
that
was
cancelled
when
the
cancer
was
discovered
in
his
liver
in
order
to
avoid
delaying
the
start
of
chemotherapy
.

The
spare
,
soft-spoken
son
of
an
Italian
stonecutter
took
over
the
Chicago
archdiocese
,
the
nation
's
second-largest
after
Los
Angeles
,
with
2.3
million
parishioners
,
in
_DIGIT_
.

Ironically
,
Bernardin
,
who
developed
a
progressive
,
much-praised
programme
to
deal
with
pedophilia
involving
priests
,
became
the
highest-ranking
church
official
ever
accused
of
sexual
improprieties
when
a
former
seminary
student
leveled
charges
in
_DIGIT_
that
he
had
been
sexually
abused
by
Bernardin
during
the
1970s
.

Bernardin
steadfastly
denied
the
charges
and
the
former
student
later
recanted
his
tale
of
abuse
.

Bernardin
prayed
with
him
before
he
died
from
_CAP_
last
year
.

Bernardin
,
who
became
archbishop
of
Cincinnati
in
_DIGIT_
,
played
an
increasingly
prominent
role
in
the
U.S.
church
as
a
moderate
voice
of
compromise
among
liberals
and
conservatives
in
the
ranks
of
the
bishops
.

This
month
,
he
announced
that
he
would
oversee
a
series
of
conferences
to
find
"
common
ground
"
among
American
Catholics
.

Previously
,
he
was
instrumental
in
drafting
church
policy
on
war
,
peace
and
nuclear
arms
,
and
for
seven
years
he
headed
the
bishops
'
anti-abortion
policy
committee
,
espousing
a
policy
describing
human
life
as
a
"
seamless
garment

The
$
9.5
billion
proposed
acquisition
of
Boatmen
's
Bancshares
Inc.
by
NationsBank
Corp.
could
spark
a

of

involving

,
which
until

were
protected
from
outside

by
state
regulations

Bancorp
Inc.
,
a

holding

with

18.04
billion
in
assets
,
was

by

as
the

.

Kansas

Bancshares

,
analysts
added
.

"
It
focuses
more
attention
on

said
James
Weber
,
analyst
at

"
Weber
said

Mercantile

did
not
return
phone
calls
seeking
comment
.

Among
those
seen
as
having
an
interest
in

are
Minneapolis-based
First

said
the

do
not
comment

contacted

would

Boatmen

in

,
where
barriers
to
outside
acquirers
were
brought
down
last

by
a
federal
banking
statute
.

"
Boatmen
's
was
the
plum
of
Missouri
and
was
the
plum
of
the
central
Midwest
,
"
Weber
said
.

Talk
that
the
Missouri
banks
were
seeking
inflated
prices
from
buyers
was
seen
as
a
reason
a
deal
has
not
occurred
sooner
.

But
NationsBank
's
bid
,
representing
a
premium
of
_DIGIT_
percent
for
Boatmen
's
stock
,
was
large
enough
to
get
the
deal
done
.

"
_CAP_
think
Boatmen
's
was
shopping
itself
,
and
everybody
knew
if
you
wanted

be
the
winning
buyer
here
,
you
had
to
make
the
bid
nobody

beat
,
"
Ancell
said
.

But
some
analysts
cautioned
that
other
targets
should
not
expect
as
large
a
premium
.

They
also
questioned
whether
NationsBank
can
recoup
shareholder
value
with
such
a
large
bid
for
Boatmen
's
.

"
_CAP_
think
initially
some
stocks
will
trade
up
on
sympathy

the
wild

NationsBank
put
on

here

_CAP_
do
n't
see

The

refused
to
speculate
on

on

,
the

who

'm
not

about
what

"
State

"

The

noted
:
"
We

but
he
did

The

on

denied
Farrakhan
's
application
to
receive
the
$
_DIGIT_
award
or
a
$
_DIGIT_

donation
Libyan
leader
Muammar
Gaddafi
had
pledged
to
Farrakhan

group
after
they
met

Farrakhan
organised
last

The

said
Libya

centre
in
East
Jerusalem
.

City
officials
there
said
the

was
being
erected
illegally
.

But
Palestinian
President
Yasser
Arafat
said
the

by
Prime

Benjamin
Netanyahu
's

were
tantamount
to
war
.

Tension
has
been
rising
in
the
region
since
.

"
We
believe
that
the
Israeli
settlement
policy
in
the
occupied
areas
is
an
obstacle
to
the
establishment
of
peace
,
"
German
Foreign
Ministry
spokesman
Martin
Erdmann
said
.

"
All
concerned
must
avoid
taking
any
course
of
action
that
could
pose
an
obstacle
to
the
peace
process
and
which
could
make
a
peaceful
solution
difficult
,
"
he
said
,
as
news
came
of
a
renewed
breakdown
in
Arab-Israeli
peace
talks
in
Jerusalem
.

Erdmann
told

Bonn
supported
European
Union
efforts
to
persuade
Israel
to
stop
further
Jewish
settlement
on

West

.

The

later
announced
Israeli
Foreign
Minister
David
Levy
would
visit
Bonn
for
talks
with
his
German

Klaus
Kinkel
next

.

The

said
Levy
and
Kinkel
would
discuss
the
Middle
East
process
and
German-Israeli

at

on

_DIGIT_

Levy
's

by

minister
since

took
power
in

,
the

Syria
slams
Israel
on
settlements

_CAP_
1996-08-30

Syria
on
Friday
condemned
Israel
's
settlement
policy
and
said
Prime
Minister
Benjamin
Netanyahu
was
preparing
for
war
with
Arabs
.

"
Practices
of
the
Israeli
government
,
especially
its
settlement
activities
,
came
to
confirm
that
dealing
with
this
government
inflicts
the
biggest
harm
on
the
Arab
cause
,
"
state-run
Damascus
Radio
said
in
a
commentary
.

"
When
this
government
insists
on
stabbing
the
peace
process
and
tearing
it
apart
,
this
means
that
it
is
preparing
for
war
,
"
the
radio
said
.

Palestinian
President
Yasser
Arafat
described
this
week
the
decision
to
expand
settlements
in
the
West
Bank
as
a
declaration
of
war
.

Palestinians
in
the
West
Bank
and
Gaza
observed
a
strike
on
Thursday
to
protest
against
the
Israeli
move
.

The
radio
urged
Arabs
to
unify
their
ranks
to
thwart
the
policies
of
the
right-wing
Israeli
government
.

"
Israel
could
not
confront
a
united
Arab
stand
or
usurp
their
rights
because
the
Arab
rights
could
be
regained
when
they
achieve
unity
and
solidarity
,
"
Damascus
radio
said
.

It
welcomed
the
international
criticism
of
Israel
's
settlement
policies
but
called
for
practical
steps
to
force
the
Israeli
government
to
abandon
this
policy
.

"
It
is
important
to
translate
the
criticism
into
pressuring
action
to
prevent
Israel
from
undermining
the
big
international
efforts
aimed
at
making
the
peace
process
achieve
success
,
"
the
radio
said
.

Syria
and
Arabs
have
been
dismayed
by
Netanyahu
's
refusal
to
trade
the
occupied
Arab
lands
for
peace
,
his
support
for
the
expansion
of
settlements
and
his
insistance
on
Jerusalem

K-SHEETS
:

Consumer
spending
,
incomes
edge
up
in
July
.

Glenn
Somerville

_CAP_
1996-08-30

Consumer
spending
barely
edged
up
in
July
,
the
Commerce
Department
said
Friday
,
as
income
growth
slowed
abruptly
to
the
weakest
pace
in
six
months
.

Spending
rose
0.2
percent
to
a
seasonally
adjusted
annual
rate
of
$
5.15
trillion
after
dropping
a
revised
0.4
percent
in
June
.

Incomes
from
wages
,
salaries
and
all
other
sources
gained
0.1
percent
to
a
rate
of
$
6.47
trillion
after
a
0.9
percent
jump
in
June
.

Department
officials
said
July
's
slight
gain
in
incomes
was
the
weakest
for
any
month
since
January
,
when
they
were
flat
.

Wages
and
salaries
came
under
pressure
in
July
as
a
shorter
average
workweek
and
lower
hourly
earnings
cut
into
paychecks
.

The
department
said
wages
and
salaries
decreased
by
$
6.9
billion
in
July
after
climbing
$
_DIGIT_
billion
in
June
.

"
In
July
,
average
weekly
hours
and
average
hourly
earnings
declined
,
more
than
offsetting
the
effect
of
an
increase
in
employment
,
"
Commerce
said
.

But
more
money
went
into
savings
accounts
,
as
savings
held
at
5.3
cents
out
of
each
dollar
earned
in
both
June
and
July
.

That
was
the
highest
savings
rate
since
October
last
year
,
when
5.5
cents
out
of
each
dollar
earned
was
being
saved
.

The
generally
lackluster
report
on
spending
and
incomes
in
July
had
been
expected
.

At
the
same
time
,
the
department
said
in
a
separate
report
that
new
orders
received
by
U.S.
factories
climbed
strongly
in
July
,
with
widespread
gains
across
most
major
categories
.

Orders
increased
1.8
percent
to
a
seasonally
adjusted
$
317.6
billion
,
significantly
stronger
than
the
_DIGIT_
percent
rise
forecast
by
Wall
Street
economists
.

That
followed
a
revised
0.7
percent
decline
in
June
orders
.

Commerce
said
previously
that
spending
at
retail
stores
was
up
only
0.1
percent
in
July
,
partly
because
of
softer
sales
of
new
cars
and
light
trucks
.

In
addition
,
the
Labour
Department
's
July
employment
report
had
foreshadowed
the
muted
income
growth
.

It
showed
average
hourly
earnings
fell
in
July
by
0.2
percent
to
$
11.00
and
the
average
workweek
shortened
to
34.3
hours
from
34.7
in
June
.

Gains
in
personal
income
,
which
includes
wages
and
salaries
as
well
as
income
from
sources
such
as
dividends
,
interest
and
businesses
,
are
essential
for
funding
consumer
purchases
,
which
fuel
two-thirds
of
national
economic
activity
.

Spending
on
all
types
of
durable
goods
,
which
includes
cars
,
fell
to
an
annual
rate
of
$
626.3
billion
in
July
from
$
633.6
billion
in
June
.

But
spending
on
nondurable
products
increased
moderately
to
a
rate
of
$
1.55
trillion
from
$
1.54
trillion
in
June
,
while
spending
for
services
was
up
to
$
2.97
trillion
in
July
from
$
2.96
trillion
.

Payrolls
of
manufacturing
companies
rose
in
July
by
$
2.3
billion
to
an
annual
rate
of
$
_DIGIT_
billion
.

to

dramatic

"
said
David

"

There
are
more
worries
in

land
.

Fears
of
a
Fed
tightening
next
month
have
resurfaced
for
the
first
time
since
the
end
of
July
.
"

The
Commerce
Department
reported
that
the

's
gross
domestic
product
expanded
at
a
4.8
percent
annual
rate
in
the
three
months
from
April
through
June
instead
of
the
4.2
percent
estimated
a

.

In
another
report
,
sales
of
new
homes
jumped
unexpectedly
in
July
to
the
briskest
rate
in
five
months
,
driving
prices
up
in
a
strong
housing
market
.

Sales
shot
up
7.9
percent
last

units
--
the
strongest
since

,
when

were
selling
at
a
rate

Analysts

the

the
impact
on
President

re-election
bid
of
his

he
engaged

yearlong
affair
with
a

campaign
documents
.

Analysts
said
Wall
Street
had
grown
accustomed
to
a
moderate
Republican
in
the
form
of
Democratic
President
Clinton
.

Morris
'
departure

fears

Pirelli
cables
look
to
tap
Chinese
growth
.

_CAP_
1996-08-30

Italian
tyre
and
cables
giant
Pirelli
on
Friday
announced
its
long-awaited
move
into
China
with
a
cables
joint
venture
set
to
capitalise
on
the
rapidly-growing
Chinese
telecommunications
market
.

Pirelli
is
linking
with
Hong
Kong-based
group
_CAP_
Pacific
in
a
venture
to
be
called
the
Wuxi
Tong
Ling
Company
Ltd
,
which
will
operate
in
partnership
with
a
local
industrial
company
at
its
existing
factory
in
Wuxi
,
Jiangsu
province
,
Shanghai
.

The
partners
will
invest
around
$
_DIGIT_
million
in
the
existing
copper
cable
plant
at
Wuxi
to
update
technology
and
include
optic
fibre
production
,
with
annual
turnover
expected
to
reach
$
_DIGIT_
million
within
the
next
few
years
.

The
move
marks
a
further
move
by
Pirelli
's
cables
division
to
expand
in
the
fast-growing
Far
Eastern
developing
markets
with
the
group
already
present
in
Indonesia
,
India
and
Malaysia
.

"
This
is
really
positive
news
for
Pirelli
,
and
_CAP_
expect
that
it
will
produce
one
of
the
best
half-year
results
in
late
September
compared
to
other
industrial
Italian
companies
,
"
said
analyst
Paula
Buratti
at
Indosuez
.

She
emphasised
that
the
move
was
positive
because
Pirelli
will
have
management
control
of
the
Chinese
venture
,
and
it
also
showed
another
example
of
Pirelli
exporting
its
technical
know-how
to
developing
markets
.

Pirelli
shares
reacted
favourable
even
though
talks
had
been
underway
for
some
time
and
news
about
a
venture
had
been
widely
expected
.

The
shares
rose
0.2
percent
to
_DIGIT_
lire
by
_DIGIT_
_CAP_
in
an
easier
Milan
stock
market
.

This
will
be
Pirelli
's
first
industrial
involvement
in
a
Chinese
market
where
demand
for
telecommunication
networks
is
expected
to
grow
to
80-100
million
new
lines
between
_DIGIT_
and
_DIGIT_
,
doubling
demand
for
optical
cables
.

China
's
second
largest
telecoms
operator
Unicom
already
has
a
mandate
from
the
central
government
to
establish
_DIGIT_
million
new
phone
lines
by
the
year
_DIGIT_
,
which
will
necessitate
new
trunk
line
systems
and
local
distribution
networks
.

"
The
starting
of
this
production
base
in
China
has
for
our
group
an
undoubted
strategic
value
,
representing
an
important
enhancement
of
our
presence
in
Asia
,
"
said
Pirelli
SpA
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
Marco
Tonchetti
Provera
.

Pirelli
Cables
has
global
sales
of
over
$
3.5
billion
,
and
has
become
a
large
supplier
of
optic
cables
and
systems
to
major
telecoms
carriers
in
the
U.S.
,
Europe
and
the
Far
East
.

_CAP_
Pacific
is
a
major
Hong
Kong-listed
company
focusing
on
infrastruture
,
trading
,
distribution
and
property
,
with
_DIGIT_
percent
of
its
_DIGIT_
profits
coming
from
telecoms
.

It
has
investments
in
several
industrial
joint
ventures
in
China

Dutch

_CAP_
1996-08-30

_CAP_
broad
attempt
to
spur
activity
in
Dutch
bond
futures
has
been
delayed
to
give
participants
a
chance
to
become
familiar
with
the
trading
system
,
the
European
Options
Exchange
(
_CAP_
)
said
on
Friday
.

Market-making
in
the
rarely-traded
_CAP_
contract
was
expected
to
begin
today
,
but
an
_CAP_
spokesman
said
the
_DIGIT_
banks
and
brokers
involved
in
the
initiative
needed
time
to
get
accustomed
to
changes
in
the
electronic
trading
system
.

"
It
's
not
ready
yet
.

We
found
it
wise
to
take
some
time
between
the
commitment
to
start
and
the
actual
start
,
"
_CAP_
spokesman
Lex
van
Drooge
told
Reuters
.

He
said
no
date
had
been
fixed
yet
for
the
start
of
price
making
in
the
10-year
contract
,
but
the
_CAP_
had
agreed
to
speak
again
to
the
participants
in
one
to
two
weeks
.

Investors
in
Dutch
bonds
currently
use
German
bond
futures
to
hedge
their
portfolios
because
the
_CAP_
contract
is
so
illiquid
.

_CAP_
limited
attempt
to
reinvigorate
the
contract
two
years
ago
failed
.

_CAP_
defends
record
over
Chechnya
peace
mission
.

_CAP_
1996-08-30

The
head
of
an
international
mediating
mission
defended
its
record
on
Friday
in
the
face
of
criticism
by
pro-Moscow
leaders
in
breakway
Chechnya
and
insisted
it
was
doing
its
best
to
bring
peace
to
the
region
.

Flavio
Cotti
,
the
chairman
of
the
Organisation
for
Security
and
Cooperation
in
Europe
(
_CAP_
)
,
told
German
radio
the
Vienna-based
body
viewed
the
conflict
in
Chechnya
as
an
internal
Russian
problem
.

"
The
_CAP_
is
completely
involved
.

But
one
must
not
forget
that
the
_CAP_
only
has
limited
powers
there
,
"
said
Cotti
,
who
is
also
the
Swiss
foreign
minister
.
"

Our
mission
in
Chechnya
has
done
all
it
can
within
the
given
limitations
.
"

Pro-Moscow
leaders
in
Chechnya
have
criticised
Tim
Guldimann
,
the
Swiss
diplomat
who
heads
the
_CAP_
Chechnya
mission
,
saying
he
was
biased
toward
Zelimkhan
Yandarbiyev
,
president
of
the
self-declared
separatist
government
.

Russian
peacemaker
Alexander
Lebed
and
Chechen
separatist
military
leader
Aslan
Maskhadov
started
a
new
round
of
peace
talks
on
Friday
just
outside
the
rebel
region
.

Cotti
said
Chechnya
must
remain
part
of
Russia
,
but
the
solution
to
the
conflict
would
be
to
accord
the
region
maximum
autonomy
within
Russia
's
borders
.

"
There
is
no
doubt
that
Chechnya
,
according
to
_CAP_
principles
,
belongs
to
a
state
called
Russia

The

told

that
there
is
no

to

the

crash
of
an

which
left

in

a

from

for

further
information
about
the
contents
of
its

had
been
complied

by

in

The

had
come
in
for
pressure
from

in

this

,
some
of
whom
believed
the

had
been
carrying
unlisted
,
dangerous
goods
.

Others
said
they
thought
the
aircraft
was
loaded
with
too
much
airfreight
.

Jorritsma
said
the
latest

from
El

in
no
way
supported
the

,
and
added
there

no
justification

Representatives

Azerbaijan
held
talks
earlier
this

in
Germany
on
bringing
a
lasting
peace
to
the
disputed
Nagorno-Karabakh
region
,
a
diplomatic
source
close
to
the

said
on

The

said
Azerbaijani
presidential

and
his
Armenian

met
to
discuss
the
disputed
enclave
on
Wednesday
and
had
now
flown
home
.

An

has
prevailed
in
Nagorno-Karabakh
,
which
represents
around
_DIGIT_
percent
of
Azeri
territory
,
since
May
_DIGIT_
after
ethnic
Armenians
drove
Azeris
out

.

The

which

"
The

was

for

He
declined
to
reveal
any

their
exact

Azerbaijan
has
said
it
is
prepared

to

if
Armenian
forces
pull
out
,
but
will
not
accept
Armenia

The
windblown
,
chilly
streets
of
this
tiny
Arctic
town
are
all
but
deserted
and
flags
are
flying
at
half-mast
beneath
a
brooding
,
clouded
sky
.

Longyear
is
a
town
in
mourning
,
a
close-knit
community
that
has
been
shattered
.

Disaster
struck
on
Thursday
when
a
Russian
airliner
bringing
coal
miners
to
work
crashed
as
it
came
in
to
land
at

,
killing
all

He
was
one

who
raced
to
the
scene
of
the

in

on
Thursday
,
hoping
in

to
find

.

The
plane
smashed
into
a
snow-capped
mountain
on
the
Arctic
island
of
Spitzbergen
on
Thursday
,
just
east
of
Longyear
.

"
Imagine
a

mixed
together
,
with

"
Onarheim
,
_DIGIT_

told

Police

site
,
protecting
it
from
intrusive

and
from
the

The

were
all

,
coming

in

of
Barentsburg

.

Longyear

It

We

They

be
having
a

_DIGIT_
minutes
by

from

asked
to
be
left
alone
with
its
grief
and
told
reporters
to
stay
away
.

Around
_DIGIT_
Russian
and
Ukrainian
miners
were
waiting
in
Longyear
to
fly
home
on
the

They
were

shelter
in

At

"
The
members
expressed
their
concern
about
the
maintenance
of
the
peace
process
and
they
urged
that
no
action
be
taken
that
would
have
a
negative
impact
on
the
negotiations
,
"
Eitel
said
after
an
informal
council
session
.

"
They
asked
me
to
call
in
the
Israeli
charge
d'affaires
and
discuss
the
matter
with
him
,
"
he
added
.

The
Palestinian
letter
from
Marwan
Jilani
said
the
destruction
of
the
Jerusalem
centre
was
an
effort
by
Israel
to
"
alter
the
character
,
demographic
composition
and
status
of
the
Holy
City
of
Jerusalem
"
and
violated
agreements
between
Israel
and
the
Palestinian
Liberation
Organisation
.

"
This
most
recent
measure
represents
a
revival
of
old
,
malicious
plans
to
confiscate
the
land
and
build
units
for
Israeli
settlers
within
the
walls
of
the
Old
City
.
"

"
We
expect
the
international
community
to
take
a
clear
and
firm
position
,
based
on
international
law
and
in
accordance
with
U.N.
resolutions
,
against
all
such
Israeli
violations
and
illegal
practices
,
"
he
said
.

On
Tuesday
,
Israeli
crews
hoisted
a
bulldozer
over
the
walls
of
Jerusalem
's
old
city
and
demolished
the
centre
,
saying
it
was
being
restored
without
a
building
permit
.

Canada
had
recently
donated
$
_DIGIT_
million
to
the
centre
,
called
the
Burj
al-Laqlaq
Society
.

_CAP_
late
goal
by
newly-signed
defender
Roberto
Carlos
saved
the
blushes
of
Real
Madrid
coach
Fabio
Capello
and
his
multi-billion
peseta
line-up
in
the
opening
game
of
the
Spanish
championship
on
Saturday
.

The
Brazilian
's
79th-minute
effort
was
enough
to
earn
Real
a
point
from
a
scrappy
1-1
draw
at
fellow
title
contenders
Deportivo
Coruna
.

Deportivo
started
strongly
,
taking
the
lead
midway
through
the
first
half
when
former
Auxerre
playmaker
Corentine
Martins
headed
home
a
corner
after
a
flick-on
by
Brazilian-born
Spanish
international
midfielder
Donato
.

Real
looked
to
be
in
deep
trouble
shortly
after
the
break
when
Luis
Milla
was
sent
off
for
committing
two
bookable
offences
in
as
many
minutes
.

But
Deportivo
were
unable
to
capitalise
on
their
numerical
advantage
,
and
were
themselves
reduced
to
ten
men
when
Armando
Alvarez
was
sent
off
_DIGIT_
minutes
from
time
.

Shortly
afterwards
Roberto
Carlos
found
space
in
the
home
defence
and
equalised
for
Real
with
a
shot
that
was
deflected
past
despairing
Deportivo
'
keeper
Jacques
Songo'o
.

In
a
frantic
final
five
minutes
there
were
chances
at
both
ends
,
and
Donato
,
who
had
earlier
been
booked
,
was
sent
off
for
protesting
about
the
incursion
of
Real
players
at
a
free
kick
.

Before
the
match
Deportivo
chairman
Augusto
Lendoiro
said
he
would
ignore
a
_CAP_
decision
banning
Brazilian
midfielder
Mauro
Silva
from
playing
in
the
match
for
failing
to
join
his
national
side
's
tour
of
Europe
.

In
the
event
,
coach
John
Toshack
decided
not
to
use
Silva
,
who
had
claimed
he
did
not
join
the
Brazil
squad
because
he
had
lost
his
passport
.

The
Republic
of

's

dispelled
painful
memories
of
their
last
visit
to
Liechtenstein
by
beating
the
Alpine
part-timers
5-0
in

on

.

The

,
under

just

give
the

Juan
Gonzalez
homered
twice
and
Ivan
Rodriguez
added
a
two-run
shot
as
the
Texas
Rangers
defeated
the
Cleveland
Indians
5-3
in
a
matchup
of
division
leaders
Friday
.

Rodriguez
's
18th
homer
,
off
Chad
Ogea
(
7-5
)
in
the
first
,
gave
Texas
a
2-0
lead
.

One
out
later
,
Gonzalez
smacked
his
40th
homer
,
extending
his
hitting
streak
to
_DIGIT_
games
.

Gonzalez
,
who
hit
in
_DIGIT_
straight
games
earlier
this
season
,
joined
Mickey
Rivers
as
the
only
players
in
Texas
history
with
two
20-game
streaks
in
the
same
year
.

Gonzalez
hit
his
second
homer
in
the
third
for
his
fifth
multi-homer
game
of
the
season
.

Gonzalez
has
three
40-homer
seasons
and
his
_DIGIT_
_CAP_
broke
Ruben
Sierra
's
team
record
of
_DIGIT_
set
in
_DIGIT_
.

The
Indians
had
their
four-game
winning
streak
stopped
.

"
It
's
not
something
_CAP_
'm
going
to
try
to
explain
,
"
said
Texas
manager
Johnny
Oates
about
his
team
winning
seven
of
the
_DIGIT_
meetings
from
Cleveland
this
season
.

"
We
've
got
two
more
regular
season
games
against
them
and
we
might
get
lucky
enough
or
unlucky
enough
to
play
them
in
the
post-season
.
"

Roger
Pavlik
(
15-7
)
gave
up
three

.

Jeff

Central
dropped

Texas
's
lead
over

At

homer
keyed
a
three-run
first
and
Andy
Pettitte
became
the
league
's
first
19-game
winner
as
the
New
York
Yankees
beat
the
Angels
6-2
.

New
York
snapped
a
season-high
five-game
losing
streak
and
also
got
homers
from
Mariano
Duncan
,
Darryl
Strawberry
and
Jim
Leyritz
.

striking
out
two
.

Randy
Velarde
hit
his

,
his
most
at
any
professional
level
.

In
Seattle
,
Pete
Incaviglia
's
grand
slam
with
one
out
in
the
sixth
snapped
a
tie
and
lifted
the
Baltimore

past
the
Seattle

.

It
was
Incaviglia

a
game
back
.

In

losing
streak
.

Buddy
Groom
pitched
a
perfect
ninth
inning
.

McGwire
singled
home
a
run
to
spark
a
three-run
sixth
and
capped
the
scoring

time
this

He

Essex
and
Kent
both
face
tense
finishes
on
Monday
as
they
attempt
to
keep
pace
with
title
hopefuls
Derbyshire
and
Surrey
,
convincing
three-day
victors
on
Saturday
,
in
the
English
county
championship
run-in
.

Essex
need
another
_DIGIT_
with
five
wickets
in
hand
to
beat
Yorkshire
after
a
maiden
first-class
century
from
Richard
Kettleborough
transformed
a
match
which
his
side
had
seemed
certain
to
lose
.

Kent
will
also
need
to
keep
their
nerve
against
struggling
Nottinghamshire
who
will
enter
the
final
day
_DIGIT_
ahead
with
four
wickets
left
in
a
relatively
low-scoring
match
at
Tunbridge
Wells
.

Derbyshire
,
nine-wicket
winners
over
Worcestershire
,
and
Surrey
,
who
thrashed
Warwickshire
by
an
innings
and
_DIGIT_
runs
,
can
instead
take
the
day
off
along
with
rivals
Leicestershire
,
who
beat
Somerset
inside
two
days
.

Warwickshire
captain
Tim
Munton
is
tipping
Surrey
to
emerge
on
top
,
impressed
by
the
positive
influence
of
Australian
coach
Dave
Gilbert
,
but
Derbyshire
's
Australian
captain
Dean
Jones
is
conceding
nothing
as
his
side
chase
their
first
title
for
_DIGIT_
years
.

"
We
took
three
absolutely
brilliant
catches
in
this
match
and
our
catching
all
season
has
been
pretty
impressive
.

Our
catching
will
win
or
lose
us
the
championship
,

Former
Wallaby
captain
Michael
Lynagh
began
his
career
in
English
club
rugby
in
impeccable
fashion
on
Saturday
to
frustrate
his
old
coach
Bob
Dwyer
on
his
league
coaching
debut
with
Leicester
.

Lynagh
kicked
five
penalties
and
a
conversion
from
his
six
attempts
at
goal
to
steer
his
multi-national
Saracens
side
to
a
25-23
home
win
and
offer
millionaire
backer
Nigel
Wray
an
early
return
on
his
big
investment
in
the
north
London
club
.

French
centre
Philippe
Sella
also
enjoyed
a
good
game
alongside
Lynagh
,
although
the
home
team
scored
only
one
try
through
England
scrum-half
Kyran
Bracken
.

The
new
French
connection
at
Harlequins
also
made
a
good
start
,
Laurent
Cabannes
and
Laurent
Benezech
scoring
a
try
apiece
in
their
side
's
75-19
victory
over
Gloucester
.

Former
England
captain
Will
Carling
,
handed
the
kicking
duties
,
finished
with
_DIGIT_
points
.

With
the

league
season
briefly
shifting
the
spotlight
away
from
the
discord
between

there

,
56-13

South
Africa
managed
to
avoid
a
fifth
successive
defeat
in
_DIGIT_
at
the
hands
of
the
All
Blacks
with
an
emphatic
32-22
victory
in
front
of
an
ecstatic
Ellis
Park
crowd
on
Saturday
.

They
scored
three
tries
in
recording
their
highest
total
against
New
Zealand
,
salvaging
some
pride
in
a
season
in
which
the
world
champions
have
lost
five
out
of
eight
tests
.

It
also
ended
a
run
of
nine
successive
victories
this
year
for
New
Zealand
but
arrived
too
late
to
prevent
a
2-1
series
defeat
and
an
historic
first
All
Black
series
triumph
on
South
African
soil
.

Springbok
scrum-half
Joost
van
der
Westhuizen
was
his
side
's
inspiration
,
scoring
their
opening
try
and
making
the
third
for
flanker
Andre
Venter
from
a
quickly
taken
penalty
to
give
his
side
a
29-8
lead
after
_DIGIT_
minutes
.

Fullback
Andre
Joubert
scored
the
other
,
scorching
in
from
_DIGIT_
metres
at
the
start
of
the
second
half
to
add
to
his
three
long-range
penalties
.

The
All
Blacks
salvaged
some
pride
by
scoring
two
tries
from
centre
Walter
Little
and
scrum-half
Justin
Marshall
in
the
final
five
minutes
to
close
a
gap
which
at
one
point
stood
at
_DIGIT_
points
.

But
they
generally
endured
an
off-day
,
highlighted
by
recalled
fly-half
Andrew
Mehrtens
who
missed
five
out
of
eight
kicks
at
goal
.

Recalled
fly-half
Henry
Honiball
kicked
the
Springboks
into
a
6-0
lead
after
_DIGIT_
minutes
only
to
see
Andrew
Mehrtens
launch
a
penalty
from
eight
metres
inside
his
own
half
to
narrow
the
gap
.

Mehrtens
missed
three
further
penalties
and
a
conversion
in
the
first
_DIGIT_
minutes
which
could
have
put
his
side
ahead
,
but
it
was
the
Springboks
who
looked
the
more
dangerous
.

Their
promise
was
realised
when
Joubert
made
a
40-metre
break
in
the
25th
minute
and
,
although
winger
Pieter
Hendriks
appeared
to
knock
on
Joubert
's
reverse
pass
,
Welsh
referee
Derek
Bevan
allowed
Van
der
Westhuizen
to
pick
up
and
score
under
the
posts
.

Honiball
converted
and
Joubert
kicked
a
penalty
before
All
Black
hooker
Sean
Fitzpatrick
scored
a
try
from
close
range
on
the
stroke
of
half-time
to
narrow
the
lead
to
16-8
and
hint
at
a
comeback
.

Instead
Joubert
kicked
another
long
penalty
and
then
raced
around
the
outside
of
the
defence
to
score
the
Springboks
'
second
try
.

_CAP_
quick
penalty
from
Van
der
Westhuizen
five
metres
from
the
All
Black
line
set
up
the
third
try
for
Venter
five
minutes
later
and
when
Joubert
kicked
his
third
penalty
the
Springboks
held
an
unassailable
32-8
lead
going
into
the
last
quarter
.

When
the
All
Blacks
did
break
through
,
it
was
too
late
.

Centre
Walter
Little
followed
up
Mehrtens
'
kick
to
score
under
the
posts
and
scrum-half
Justin
Marshall
forced
himself
over
from
a
ruck
close
to
the
line
in
injury-time
to
give
them
some
consolation
.

England
's
irrepressible
midfielder
Paul
Gascoigne
was
up
to
his
old
tricks
on
Saturday
,
pulling
down
his
team
mate
Paul
Ince
's
trousers
in
front
of
an
astonished
crowd
in
Moldova
.

Ince
was
clambering
over
a
wall
at
the
Republican
stadium
in
Chisinau
as
Glenn
Hoddle
's
England
players
tried
to
escape
heavy
rain
during
an

.

Gascoigne
,
whose
compulsive
practical
joking
has
landed
him
in
trouble
in

past
,
tugged
down
the
Inter
Milan
player
's
trousers
in
front
of
a
group
of
press
photographers
.

Hoddle
,
coaching
the
side
for
the

,
declined
to
comment
on
the
incident
.

Controversial
Australian
Anthony
Hill
called
Jansher
Khan
a
cheat
during
his
acrimonious
defeat
by
the
world
number
one
in
the
Hong
Kong
Open
semifinals
on
Saturday
.

The
match
boiled
over
when
Hill
made
to
walk
off
court
after
what
he
claimed
was
a
game-winning
point
in
the
third
.

When
the
referee
called
Jansher
's
return
good
and
the
decision
was
accepted
by
the
player
,
Hill
shrieked
at
the
Pakistani
:
"
You
cheat
.
"

"
He
was
standing
right
there
and
knew
the
shot
was
down
so
_CAP_
called
him
a
cheat
,
"
said
Hill
,
whose
squash
career
has
been
blighted
by
fines
and
suspensions
for
unacceptable
behaviour
.

"
He
knew
it
was
down
and
accepted
what
_CAP_
called
him
because
of
that
.
"

Hill
won
the
game
on
the
next
point
and
said
later
that
Jansher
was
generally
honest
on
court
but
played
by
the
referee
's
decision
.

The
Australian
had
upset
Jansher
's
rhythm
with
his
mixture
of
gamesmanship
and
fluent
stroke-making
but
eventually
succumbed
15-7
17-15
14-15
15-8
.

"
_CAP_
changed
my
strategy
against
him
today
and
had
him
rattled
,
"
he
added
.

He
is
not
as
fit
as
he
used
to
be
be
but
was
too
good
for
me
in
the
end
.

_CAP_
shook
him
a
bit
but
he
will
come
out
next
time
and
be
a
better
player
for
it
--
that
's
Jansher
.
"

Jansher
said
that
he
was
disturbed
to
be
called
a
cheat
.
"

What
he
did
was
bad
for
squash
,
bad
for
the
crowd
and
bad
for
the
sponsors
.

"
We
are
trying
to
build
up
squash
like
tennis
and
players
should
not
say
things
like
that
.

"
_CAP_
think
the
Professional
Squash
Association
should
look
into
this
matter
and
deal
with
it
properly
.

_CAP_
am
not
calling
for
him
to
be
banned
but
they
have
to
take
some
action
.
"

Jansher
,
bidding
for
an
eighth
Hong
Kong
Open
title
,
plays
second-seeded
Australian
Rodney
Eyles
in
the
final
.

Eyles
played
his
best
squash
of
the
tournament
to
beat
fourth-seeded
Peter
Nicol
of
Scotland
15-10
8-15
15-10
15-4
.

Eyles
,
who
defeated
Jansher
in
the
semifinals
of
the
Portuguese
Open
in
_DIGIT_
,
said
that
he
would
like
to
win
for
the
good
of
the
game
.

"
_CAP_
have
nothing
against
Jansher
but
it
will
be
great
if
_CAP_
could
beat
him
,
"
said
Eyles
.
"

My
biggest
problem
against
Jansher
is
concentration
.

_CAP_
want
to
beat
him
so
badly
that
_CAP_
just
cannot
get
it
together
.

Jesper
Parnevik
of
Sweden
fired
a
course
record-tying
eight-under-par
_DIGIT_
Saturday
to
take
a
one-shot
lead
into
the
final
round
of
the
$
1.2
million
Greater
Milwaukee
Open
.

Parnevik
,
who
is
seeking
his
first
_CAP_
Tour
victory
,
moved
to
19-under
_DIGIT_
for
the
tournament
.

Parnevik
tied
the
18-hole
record
set
by
Loren
Roberts
in
_DIGIT_
at
the
Brown
Deer
Park
Golf
Course
and
also
equalled
Saturday
by
Greg
Kraft
.

Nolan
Henke
,
who
led
by
two
strokes
entering
the
third
round
,
carded
a
four-under
_DIGIT_
and
was
one
stroke
back
at
18-under
_DIGIT_
.

He
is
striving
for
his
fourth
career
_CAP_
Tour
victory
and
first
since
the
_DIGIT_
BellSouth
Classic
.

Tiger
Woods
,
who
made
the
cut
in
his
first
tournament
as
a
professional
,
shot
a
two-over-par
_DIGIT_
and
was
four
under
for
the
tournament
.

The
20-year-old
Woods
,
who
turned
professional
Tuesday
after
winning
an
unprecedented
third
successive
U.S.
Amateur
Championship
,
struggled
on
the
front
nine
,
bogeying
the
first
and
seventh
holes
and
double-bogeying
the
par-four
,
359-yard
ninth
hole
.

After
bogeying
the
10th
hole
to
move
to
four-over
for
the
round
,
he
rallied
for
birdies
on
_DIGIT_
and
_DIGIT_
.

After
Parnevik
started
off
his
round
by
parring
the
first
hole
and
bogeying
the
second
,
the
Swede
birdied
six
of
the
next
seven
holes
.

Parnevik
continued
to
storm
through
the
course
,
birdying
three
holes
on
the
back
nine
,
including
two
from
_DIGIT_
feet
out
on
the
15th
and
17th
holes
.

"
_CAP_
ca
n't
remember
when
_CAP_
've
putted
this
well
,
"
said
Parnevik
.
"

_CAP_
was
disappointed
when
a
12-footer
did
n't
go
in
.

"
My
game
feels
very
good
.

_CAP_
've
been
fading
my
driver
but
today
whenever
_CAP_
set
up
for
a
fade
it
went
straight
.

Whenever
everyone
's
making
birdies
,
you
never
want
to
be
even
par
.
"

Henke
had
a
bogey-free
round
and
birdied
four
holes
,
including
a
45-footer
on
the
par-three
215-yard
seventh
hole
and
one
from
_DIGIT_
feet
out
on
the
12th
hole
.

"
_CAP_
did
n't
hit
it
very
well
today
,
"
said
Henke
.
"

Jasper
blew
right
by
me
.

Once
he
did
,
_CAP_
knew
_CAP_
had
to
make
birdies
just
to
keep
up
.

_CAP_
made
some
really
good
pars
.

_CAP_
basically
picked
up
where
_CAP_
left
off
yesterday
afternoon
.

"
Right
now
,
_CAP_
ca
n't
put
my
finger
on
what
's
wrong
.
"

Bob
Estes
shot
a
_DIGIT_
for
sole
possession
of
third
place
at
15-under
.

Steve
Stricker
,
who
tied
for

and

at
the
draw
.
"

That
is
our
sole
goal
.
"

The
United
States
edged
Austria
in
Salzburg
3-2
in
the
opening
round
in
April
,
and
then
blanked
Japan
5-0
in
Nagoya
last
month
in
the
semifinals
.

The
victory
against
Japan
marked
the
Fed
Cup
debut
of
Monica
Seles
,
who
became
a
naturalised
U.S.
citizen
in
_DIGIT_
.

Seles
easily
won
both
her
singles
matches
and
King
is
counting
on
the
co-world
number
one
to
lead
the
team
again
.

"
_CAP_
told
Monica
we
need
her
if
we
want
to
win
,
"
King
said
.

Seles
's
sore
left
shoulder
and
a
wrist
injury
to
Fed
Cup
veteran
Mary
Joe
Fernandez
have
forced
King
to
take
a
wait
and
see
attitude
regarding
her
squad
for
the
best-of-five
match
.

Fernandez
was
forced
to
withdraw
from
the
U.S.
Open
.

"
We
will
wait
until
the
last
minute
so
we
check
with
everybody
and
their
injuries
,
"
said
King
.
"

What
we
like
would
be
Seles
,
(
Olympic
champion
Lindsay
)
Davenport
and
Mary
Joe
Fernandez
.
"

If
she
can
get
that
threesome
together
,
King
will
feel
good
about
her
chances
against
the
Spain
's
formidable
duo
of
Arantxa
Sanchez
Vicario
and
Conchita
Martinez
.

"
To
be
a
great
coach
you
have
to
have
the
right
horses
and
_CAP_
got
the
right
horses
,
"
said
King
.

Major
league
_CAP_
leader
Kevin
Brown
threw
an
eight-hitter
and
Devon
White
's
_CAP_
double
snapped
a
fifth-inning
tie
as
the
Florida
Marlins
beat
the
Cincinnati
Reds
3-1
for
their
seventh
straight
win
Friday
.

Brown
(
14-10
)
tied
Todd
Stottlemyre
of
the
Cardinals
for
the
National
League
lead
with
his
fifth
complete
game
and
lowered
his
major
league-leading
earned
run
average
from
1.96
to
1.92
.

He
struck
out
eight
and
did
not
walk
a
batter
.

Brown
threw
_DIGIT_
pitches
and
won
for
the
third
time
in
as
many
starts
against
the
Reds
this
season
.

"
Bolesy
(
Florida
manager
John
Boles
)
told
me
yesterday
,
'
You
have
to
go
nine
tomorrow
,
'
"
Brown
said
.

"
In
the
early
innings
,
_CAP_
was
struggling
,
_CAP_
was
just
trying
to
make
it
from
pitch
to
pitch
.

_CAP_
gave
up
a
lot
of
hits
in
the
early
innings
and
_CAP_
was
n't
thinking
about
the
seventh
,
eighth
or
ninth
.

_CAP_
was
n't
satisfied
with
any
of
my
pitches
and
_CAP_
did
a
better
job
of
moving
the
ball
around
in
the
later
innings
.
"

"
He
has
a
devastating
sinker
,
"
observed
Reds
manager
Ray
Knight
.
"

The
guys
say
it
moved
more
than
everyone
in
the
league
.

_CAP_
remember
Nolan
Ryan
saying
in
'
_DIGIT_
or
'
_DIGIT_
that
he
was
the
best
young
pitcher
coming
around
in
a
long
time
and
he
saw
(
Tom
)
Seaver
and
(
Jerry
)
Koosman
when
they
were
starting
.
"

In
Philadelphia
,
Delino
DeShields
's
triple
in
the

off
Jeff

Curtis
and
lifted
the
Los
Angeles
Dodgers

the
Phillies
.

Los
Angeles
won
for
the
seventh
time

Darren
Dreifort
(
1-1

picked
up
the
win
after
allowing

hit
and
a
walk
over

1/3
scoreless
innings
.

Todd
Worrell
worked
the

to
earn
his
league-leading
37th

(
13-8
)
for

win
,
3-2
.

Foster
,
a
.333
hitter
,
helped
his
own
cause
in
the
second
with
a
two-run
single
.

The
Braves
took
the
second
game
when
Chipper
Jones
singled
home
the
tying
run
in
the
top
of
the
ninth
and
Andruw
Jones
took
advantage
of
a
poor
throw
to
score
the
go-ahead

fly
for

victory
.

Cubs

but

The

Refusing
to
go
quietly
in
the
night
,
Stefan
Edberg
extended
his
stay
at
his
14th
and
last
U.S.
Open
when
Bernd
Karbacher
,
trailing
and
hurting
,
quit
in
the
fourth
set
of
their
second-round
match
Friday
.

The
30-year-old
Edberg
,
a
former
two-time
Open
champion
,
had
wrestled
control
of
the
match
away
from
Karbacher
when
the
German
,
hampered
by
a
left
hamstring
injury
,
decided
he
could
n't
continue
under
the
stadium
lights
at
the
National
Tennis
Centre
.

"
_CAP_
win
is
a
win
.

_CAP_
'll
take
it
,
"
Edberg
,
who
has
announced
that
this
will
be
his
last
Grand
Slam
event
,
said
of
the
3-6
6-3
6-3
1-0
victory
.

Ironically
,
Karbacher
two
years
ago
ended
Ivan
Lendl
's
Grand
Slam
career
here
when
the
former
champion
had
to
retire
in
the
middle
of
their
first-round
match
.

After
seeing
the
trainer
come
out
early
in
the
third
set
,
Edberg
was
not
surprised
by
Karbacher
's
decision
not
to
go
on
.

"
_CAP_
knew
he
had
problems
with
something
,
"
Edberg
said
.
"

_CAP_
really
was
n't
surprised
.
"

Edberg
had
his
own
problems
early
in
the
match
as
the
Swede
battled
to
acclimate
himself
to
the
nighttime
conditions
while
Karbacher
was
ripping
passing
shots
and
blasting
serves
past
him
.

"
_CAP_
did
n't
really
feel
good
to
begin
with
,
_CAP_
had
problems
finding
the
timing
on
the
ball
,
seeing
the
ball
,
"
said
Edberg
,
who
upset
Wimbledon
champion
and
fifth-seeded
Richard
Krajicek
in
the
first
round
.

"
This
was
one
of
these
matches
where
_CAP_
did
n't
play
up
to
my
standard
.

_CAP_
had
to
fight
hard
.
"

Edberg
's
tenacity
paid
off
in
the
second
set
.

Edberg
lost
his
own
serve
twice
,
but
he
rallied
for
three
breaks
of
his
own
,
the
last
to
wrap
up
the
set
.

"
That
's
where
the
match
sort
of
changed
,
"
said
Edberg
.
"

_CAP_
think
once
_CAP_
got
that
second
set
,
_CAP_
felt
a
lot
better
about
my
game
.
"

Edberg
is
starting
to
feel
pretty
good
about
postponing
his
swan
song
a
lot
longer
.

"
It
does
n't
look
all
that
bad
,
"
Edberg
said
of
his
path
through
the
draw
starting
next
with
a
match
against
Krajicek
's
Dutch
countryman
Paul
Haarhuis
.

However
,
the
_DIGIT_
and
_DIGIT_
champion

Austria
dominated
their
World
Cup
group
four
qualifier
against
Scotland
on
Saturday
with
wave
after
wave
of
attacks
but
were
unable
to
penetrate
the
visitors
'
defence
and
had
to
settle
for
a
goalless
draw
.

Scotland
,
who
thrashed
Belarus
5-1
in
their
opening
group
four
match
,
were
unable
to
repeat
their
performance
.

Austria
's
best
chance
came
in
the
63rd
minute
with
Stephan
Marasek
of
_CAP_
Freiburg
taking
advantage
of
a
scramble
in
the
Scottish
penalty
area
but
his
shot
narrowly
passing
the
left-hand
post
.

They
also
went
close
a
minute
before
the
interval
when
a
promising
attack
saw
the
ball
fall
to
Markus
Schopp
but
he
hit
his
shot
wide
.

Everton
's
Duncan
Ferguson
went
close
for
Scotland
in
the
65th
minute
when
he
forced
Austrian
goalkeeper
Michael
Konsel
to
a
diving
save
.

Two
Scotland
players
were
shown
yellow
cards
,
captain
Gary
McAllister
for
bringing
down
Andreas
Heraf
and
Ferguson
for
arguing
against
the
referee
's
decision
.

"
The
result
is
acceptable
,
"
Scottish
coach
Craig
Brown
told
reporters
.
"

We
'd
hoped
not
to
lose
and
we
tried
not
to
play
for
a
draw
but
the
Austrian
defence
was
simply
too
good
.
"

_CAP_
Rapid
's
Dietmar
Kuehbauer
,
who
gave
an
impressive
performance
,
said
the
team
started
off
well
but
let
the
game
slip
after
the
first
_DIGIT_
minutes
.

"
Somehow
it
seemed
there
were
less
than
_DIGIT_
players
on
the
pitch
.

We
have
lost
two
points
.

The
Scots
are
not
really
a
great
team
and
we
should
have
won
,
"
he
said
.

Austrian
coach
Herbert
Prohaska
said
his
team
had
displayed
great
fighting
spirit
but
sometimes
lacked
ideas
.

Euro
_DIGIT_
absentee
Nicolas
Ouedec
and
Youri
Djorkaeff
scored
the
goals
as
_DIGIT_
World
Cup
hosts
France
beat
Mexico
2-0
in
a
friendly
international
on
Saturday
.

The
victory
extended
to
_DIGIT_
matches
France
's
unbeaten
run
under
coach
Aime
Jacquet
,
their
Euro
_DIGIT_
semifinal
elimination
having
come
in
a
penalty
shoot-out
,
but
was
marred
by
the
sending-off
of
Chelsea
central
defender
Franck
Leboeuf
.

Leboeuf
was
dismissed
two
minutes
from
time
for
a
second
bookable
offence
,
fouling
Mexican
substitute
Ricardo
Pelaez
who
minutes
earlier
had
also
been
shown
the
yellow
card
for
pushing
the
Chelsea
defender
in
the
back
.

Both
goals
came
early
in
the
second
half
after
France
had
surprised
the
Mexicans
with
three
half-time
substitutions
.

After
a
sterile
first
half
,
France
injected
more
sting
in
midfield
with
the
introduction
of
Juventus
's
Zinedine
Zidane
.

This
allowed
Djorkaeff
to
play
further
up
and
his
cross
from
the
right
fell
for
Ouedec
,
who
has
joined
Espanyol
of
Barcelona
from
Nantes
since
missing
the
European
championship
finals
through
injury
,
to
score
after
a
mistake
by
midfielder
Joaquin
del
Olmo
.

Within
four
minutes
Ouedec
was
returning
the
compliment
for
Djorkaeff
,
playing
a
one-two
with
the
Internazionale
Milan
forward
down
the
middle
to
set
him
up
for
a
cross
shot
past
diving
goalkeeper
Osvaldo
Sanchez
.

Jacquet
,
beginning
the
22-month
countdown
to

Belgium
kicked
off
their
_DIGIT_
World
Cup
campaign
with
a
hard-fought
2-1
victory
over
10-man
Turkey
in
a
tense
match
marred
by
Turkish
crowd
trouble
shortly
after
the
break
.

Turkish
fans
,
upset
at
their
team
's
2-0
first-half
deficit
,
ripped
apart
dozens
of
plastic
seats
and
threw
them
over
the
fence
.

Riot
police
took
_DIGIT_
minutes
to
restore
order
.

The
police
were
given
an
unexpected
hand
by
second-half
substitute
Sergen
Yalcin
who
rekindled
Turkish
hopes
in
the
61st
with
a
splendid
half-volley
which
stunned
Belgian
goalkeeper
Filip
De
Wilde
.

But
Yalcin
,
who
had
come
on
just
four
minutes
earlier
,
turned
from
hero
to
villain
barely
two
minutes
after
his
strike
when
he
was
sent
off
after
spitting
at
an
opponent
and
arguing
with
English
referee
David
Elleray
.

Marc
Degryse
had
opened
the
scoring
for
Belgium
after
_DIGIT_
minutes
,
whacking
a
low
10-metre
drive
into
the
net
after
an
incisive
pass
by
defender
Dirk
Medved
from
the
edge
of
the
penalty
area
.

Brazilian-born
Luis
Oliveira
then
gleefully
slipped
the
ball
past
goalkeeper
Rustu
Recber
from
the
right
of
the
area
to
make
it
2-0
seven
minutes
before
the
interval
,
Turkey
's
best
first-half
effort
proving
to
be
a
vicious
30-metre
shot
by
Ogun
Temizkanoglu
which
De
Wilde
tipped
over
.

The
visitors
,
seeking
to
restore
some
pride
after
failing
to
score
a
single
goal
in
Euro
_DIGIT_
in
June
,
repeatedly
ripped
through
the
left
side
of
the
home
defence
but
De
Wilde
was
able
to
block
several
sharply-angled
efforts
.

With
only
the
group
seven
winners
qualifying
automatically
for
the
_DIGIT_
finals
in
France
,
Belgium
could
not
afford
a
slip-up
at
home
and
they
frantically
chased
a
decisive
third
goal
.

But
they
were
almost
upset
_DIGIT_
minutes
from
time
when
De
Wilde
fumbled
a
hard
Arif
Erdem
shot
and
Orhan
Cikirikci
almost
pounced
on
the
loose
ball
.

Belgium
's
best
second-half
effort
came
three
minutes
later
when
Degryse
put
the
ball
over
the
bar
from
close
range
with
Recber
beaten
.

Paper
says
Thatcher
's
office
consulted
astrologer
.

_CAP_
1996-09-01

_CAP_
British
newspaper
said
Margaret
Thatcher
was
so
shaken
by
an
_CAP_
attempt
on
her
life
when
she
was
prime
minister
in
_DIGIT_
that
an
astrologer
was
asked
to
warn
her
against
future
threats
.

The
Sunday
Telegraph
quoted
Majorie
Orr
as
saying
she
did
a
horoscope
chart
for
Thatcher
,
a
Libran
,
after
she
narrowly
escaped
death
in
the
Irish
guerrilla
bombing
of
a
hotel
during
the
Conservative
Party
conference
more
than
a
decade
ago
.

Orr
said
Thatcher
's
press
secretary
Bernard
Ingram
asked
her
to
telephone
if
she
saw
any
threatening
indications
in
the
future
.

"
Bernard
Ingham
told
me
that
if
_CAP_
ever
heard
anything
that
indicated
danger
_CAP_
was
to
let
him
know
,
"
Orr
said
.

Orr
said
she
never
had
to
telephone
.

She
added
that
the
horoscope
was
purely
for
security
purposes
and
she
was
never
consulted
about
political
moves
.

Ingram
was
quoted
as
telling
the
newspaper
he
thought
astrology
was
"
a
load
of
rubbish
"
and
that
he
could
not
recall
asking
Orr
to
keep
a
watch
on
Thatcher
's
stars
.

Thatcher
,
dubbed
the
"
Iron
Lady
"
for
her
driven
,
forceful
personality
,
was
never
known
to
have
an
interest
in
the
occult
and
in
fact
has
a
university
degree
in
chemistry
.

Former
U.S.
president
Ronald
Reagan
's
wife
,
Nancy
,
admitted
in
her
biography
My
Turn
that
she
regularly
consulted
an
astrologer
to

Scottish
Labour
Party
narrowly
backs
referendum
.

_CAP_
,
Scotland
1996-08-31

British
Labour
Party
leader
Tony
Blair
won
a
narrow
victory
on
Saturday
when
the
party
's
Scottish
executive
voted
21-18
in
favour
of
his
plans
for
a
referendum
on
a
separate
parliament
for
Scotland
.

Blair
once
pledged
to
set
up
a
Scottish
parliament
if
the
Labour
won
the
next
general
election
,
which
must
be
held
by
May
_DIGIT_
.

But
many
activists
were
dismayed
when
he
abruptly
decided
earlier
this
year
to
hold
a
two-question
referendum
on
the
issue
,
asking
Scots
if
they
wanted
a
separate
parliament
and
if
it
should
have
tax-raising
powers
.

Many
party
members
argued
that
a
general
election
win
would
demonstrate
popular
support
for
a
separate
parliament
and
others
said
a
single
question
referendum
would
suffice
.

Prime
Minister
John
Major
says
the
300-year-old
union
of
the
Scottish
and
English
parliaments
will
be
a
main
plank
in
his
Conservative
Party
's
election
platform
.

Conservatives
have
only
_DIGIT_
of
the
_DIGIT_
Scottish
seats
in
parliament
and
consistently
run
third
in
opinion
polls
in
Scotland
behind
Labour

independence-seeking
Scottish
National
Party

Britain
condemns
Iraq
involvement
in

attack
.

_CAP_
1996-08-31

Britain
on
Saturday
condemned
Iraqi
involvement
in
an
attack
on
the
Kurdish
city
of
Arbil
and
said
it
was
in
close
touch
with
its
allies
.

"
We
condemn
Iraqi
involvement
.

In
no
way
can
Iraqi
involvement
be
seen
as
helpful
,
"
said
a
Foreign
Office
spokesman
.

U.N.
officials
said
that
a
Kurdish
rebel
faction
backed
up
by
Iraqi
tanks
,
heavy
artillery
and
helicopters
had
taken
control
of
half
of
the
city
after
heavy
fighting
.

Arbil
lies
within
the
so-called
safe
haven
set
up
at
the
end
of
the
_DIGIT_
Gulf
War
on
the
suggestion
of
British
Prime
Minister
John
Major
to
protect
Iraqi
Kurds
from
attack
by
the
Iraqi
military
.

The
area
is
patrolled
by
U.S.
,
French
and
British
planes
.

"
We
are
in
close
touch
with
all
our
allies

Foreign
Office
spokesman

He
declined

give

Seven
Iraqis
charged
with
hijack
.

_CAP_
1996-08-31

Seven
Iraqi
men
appeared
in
court
on
Saturday
charged
with
air
piracy
following
the
hijacking
to
Britain
of
a
Sudanese
airliner
with
_DIGIT_
people
aboard
.

The
seven
,
including
a
carpenter
and
a
businessmen
and
whose
ages
ranged
from
_DIGIT_
to
_DIGIT_
years
old
,
were
ordered
to
be
held
in
jail
until
another
hearing
next
week
.

No
pleas
were
entered
at
the
preliminary
hearing
.

They
were
accused
of
taking
over
Flight
_DIGIT_
which
was
flying
from
Khartoum
,
Sudan
,
to
Amman
,
Jordan
.

All
the
hostages
were
freed
on
Tuesday
after
the
plane
landed
at
Stansted
airport
,
north
of
London
.

The
men
have
claimed
political
asylum
in
Britain
saying
they
were
persecuted
while
in
Iraq
.

Their
court
appearance
means
they
will
face
trial
and
possible
imprisonment
in
Britain
before
their
applications
for
asylum
are
considered
.

Under
English
law
the
maximum
sentence
for
hijack
is
life
imprisonment
but
there
has
been
widespread
speculation
that
the
seven
will
receive
lesser
sentences
.

After
a
search
of
the
aircraft
following
the
hijack
,
police
found
only
knives
and
fake
explosives
.

S.
African
Afrikaners
still
seek
own
territory
.

_CAP_
_CAP_
1996-08-31

South
African
right-wing
Afrikaners
on
Saturday
revived
their
campaign
for
a
form
of
self-rule
,
identifying
a
sparsely-populated
area
in
Northern
Cape
province
as
the
best
place
for
a
home
of
their
own
.

Constand
Viljoen
,
leader
of
the
Freedom
Front
party
,
told
a
news
conference
in
Pretoria
self-determination
for
Afrikaners
could
begin
at
local
government
level
.

"
Certain
powers
can
be
delegated
from
the
provincial
level
,
towards
the
sub-regions
,
"
he
said
.

"
We
think
that
the
Afrikaner
model
within
this
new
,
multi-
ethnic
society
of
South
Africa
will
have
to
develop
experimentally
with
world
thinking
in
this
regard
.
"

Viljoen
broke
with
other
right-wing
whites
in
_DIGIT_
by
taking
part
in
the
country
's
first
all-race
elections
in
April
of
that
year
,
saying
the
only
way
to
attain
self-determination
was
by
cooperating
with
President
Nelson
Mandela
's
majority
African
National
Congress
.

Some
right-wingers
demanded
sovereignty
in
their
own
territory
in
the
run-up
to
the
elections
,
saying
the
alternative
was
war
.

Their
threats
came
to
nothing
.

Viljoen
has
hailed
clauses
in
South
Africa
's
new
constitution
as
making
possible
a
form
of
self-rule
for
the
Afrikaners
,
descendants
of
the
country
's
Dutch
,
German
and
French
settlers
.

According
to
state
television
,
Viljoen
told
the
news
conference
the
self-rule
model
should
be
introduced
in
parts
of
the
Northern
Cape
provinces
where
a
majority
of
people
--
whites
and
mixed-race
Coloureds
--
speak
Afrikaans

for
Refugees
to
avoid
any
"
policing
approach
"
and
to
calm
refugees
by
explaining
the
aims
of
the
operation
.

"
The
_CAP_
appeals
to
all
refugees
to
prepare
themselves
calmly
for
the
demands
of
the
census
agents
because
it
will
be
in
their
ultimate
interest
,
"
the
group
said
in
a
statement
.

It
said
refugees
feared
census
takers
would
use
indelible
ink
to
mark
them
so
they
could
be
detected
by
Rwandan
government
troops
and
mistreated
if
they
were
forced
back
into
Rwanda
.

U.N.
officials
said
more
than
_DIGIT_
aid
workers
will
take
part
in
the
census
from
Sunday
until
Tuesday
of
the
estimated
_DIGIT_
refugees
in
camps
around
the
eastern
Zairean
border
town
of
Goma
.

Only
about
_DIGIT_
refugees
a
week
are
returning
voluntarily
to
Rwanda
in
contrast
to
the
_DIGIT_
babies
born
in
the
camps
weekly
.

Zairean
Prime
Minister
Kengo
wa
Dondo
said
at
the
end
of
a
visit
to
Rwanda
last
week
that
the
Zairean
and
Rwandan
governments
agreed
on
an
"
organised
,
massive
and
unconditional
repatriation
"
of
the
1.1
million
Rwandan
refugees
in
Zaire
.

He
said
the
repatriation
would
be
carried
out
swiftly
and
would
be
enormous
,
starting
with
the
closure
of
refugee
camps
.

_CAP_
said
it
feared
forced
expulsions
would
start
in
days
.

Zairean
troops
expelled
_DIGIT_
refugees
in
August
last
year
.

Many
of
the
1.1
million
Rwandan
Hutu
refugees
in
Zaire
and
nearly
_DIGIT_
in
Tanzania
refuse
to
go
home
,
saying
they
fear
reprisals
for
the
_DIGIT_
genocide
in
Rwanda
of
up
to
a
million
people
by
Hutus
.

_CAP_
monitors
Moslem
move
towards

,
Bosnia

_CAP_
said
it
was
closely
monitoring
the
movement
of
about
_DIGIT_
Moslem
men
towards
the
village
of
Mahala
in
Bosnia
's
Serb
republic
on
Saturday
,
two
days
after
a
violent
confrontation
with
Serbs
.

"
_CAP_
have
to
report
this
morning
that
we
have
in
fact
received
reports
...

that
up
to
_DIGIT_
Moslem
men
are
believed
to
be
approaching
Mahala
,
"
_CAP_
spokesman
Lieutenant-Colonel
Max
Marriner
said
in
Sarajevo
.

Marriner
said
that
_CAP_
troops
had
set
up
a
checkpoint
on
the
road
between
Tuzla
and
Mahala
to
establish
the
identities
and
intentions
of
the
men
headed
towards
the
village
.

Mahala
is
a
Moslem
village
on
Bosnian
Serb
republic
territory
.

Moslems
were
driven
from
the
village
during
the
43-
month
Bosnian
war
and
most
of
their
houses
were
destroyed
.

Some
Moslems
began
returning
to
rebuild
their
properties
earlier
in
the
week
.

Fights
and
shooting
broke
out
between
the
Moslems
and
Serb
police
on
Thursday
and
_CAP_
troops
finally
brought
restored
order
.

_CAP_
Reuters
reporter
who
entered
Mahala
on
Saturday
morning
found
it
tranquil
but
_CAP_
troops
and
U.N.
police
were
seen
on
the
ground
and
_CAP_
helicopters
flew
overhead
.

Chechens
exuberant
but
cautious
on

URUS-MARTAN
,
Russia
1996-08-31

Crowds
of
pro-independence
Chechens
greeted
a
newly-signed
peace
deal
by
singing
,
dancing
and
firing
guns
in
the
air
on
Saturday
,
but
the
celebrations
held
a
trace
of
uncertainty
.

More
than
a
thousand
women
,
children
and
men
gathered
in
a
field
to
the
north
of
the
town
of
Urus-Martan
on
Saturday
to
wait
for
a
column
of
rebels
to
withdraw
from
the
capital
Grozny
about
_DIGIT_
km
(
_DIGIT_
miles
)
away
.

The
men
fired
weapons
into
the
air
as
groups
of
women
danced
.

Adults
in
the
crowd
carried
posters
of
former
Chechen
leader
Dzhokhar
Dudayev
--
who
declared
independence
in
_DIGIT_
--
and
children
,
carrying
photographs
of
him
,
called
"
Troops
out
!
"

.

Russian
military
officials
have
expressed
fears
that
the
rebels
and
their
supporters
will
see
the
deal
signed
by
Russian
peace
envoy
Alexander
Lebed
in
the
early
hours
of
Saturday
as
a
military
victory
for
the
separatists
.

It
involves
the
withdrawal
of
Russian
troops
sent
to
Chechnya
in
December
_DIGIT_
to
crush
the
separatists
and
a
postponement
of
the
issue
at
the
heart
of
the
conflict
--
the
status
of
the
mainly-Moslem
North
Caucasus
region
.

But
the
people
in
the
crowd
on
Saturday
,
who
had
turned
out
in
support
of
the
rebels
,
did
not
seem
sure
that
the
war
was
over
.

"
We
hope
for
the
best
,
that
it
really
has
ended
so
we
can
live
in
peace
.

It
's
our
only
dream
,
"
said
a
30-year-old
woman
,
Mubatik
Dagayeva
.

Aiza
Dudayeva
,
with
her
10-year-old
son
beside
her
,
shared
the
guarded
optimism
.
"

We
really
want
the
war
to
end
,
we
hope
and
believe
that
our
sons
and
brothers
will
win
,
"
said
Dudayeva
,
adding
that
she
was
from
Urus-Martan
.

Urus-Martan
is
a
traditionally
anti-separatist
pocket
in
Chechnya
and
Moscow-backed
leader
Doku
Zavgayev
,
who
has
been
sidelined
in
the
peace
deal
,
has
warned
that
it
and
places
like
it
could
become
centres
of
civil
war
if
Russian
troops
leave
.

But
on
Saturday
the
people
gathered
just
outside
the
town
seemed
to
be
united
in
favour
of
the
separatists
.

Two
columns
of
rebels
appeared
in
jeeps
and
cars
,
firing
their
guns
in
the
air
,
as
the
crowd
rushed
towards
them
.

Mouldi
Mamatuyev
,
in
his
late
_DIGIT_
's
,
dressed
in
black
and
carrying
a
machine
gun
,
was
welcomed
by
his
mother
and
sister
.

"
Two
sons
have
come
back
,
"
said
his
mother
Nurbika
Mamatuyeva
.
"

It
's
the
end
.

We
believe
in
God
.
"

Mamatuyev
joked
that
his
sister
Lisa
was
a
rebel
too
,
and
she
responded
by
grabbing
hold
of
his
gun
and
shouting
the
Chechen
war
cry
"
Allahu
Akhbar
"
(
God
is
Greatest
)
and
"
Freedom
for
Chechnya
!
"

.

The
fighter
,
sitting
next
to
a
man
dressed
in
green
and
carrying
a
grenade-launcher
,
said
that
the
strict
Islamic
law
adopted
by
the
rebels
during
the
conflict
was
now
needed
to
impose
peace
.

"
The
war
has
ended
if
everything
works
out
,
if
there
is
law
there
will
be
power
.

Only
Sheriat
(
Islamic
law
)
can
end

was
the

the

which
also
included
several
listed
Polish

,
would
on

inform

in

over
five
years
--
more
than
the
sum
Ruch
says
it
needs
to
upgrade

.

Initially
Poland
offered
up
to
_DIGIT_
percent
of
Ruch
but
in
March
Kaczmarek
cancelled
the
tender
and
offered
a
minority
stake
with
an

to
increase
the
equity
.

Two
consortia
--
UWP-Hachette

placed
initial

But
after
the
change
of

conditions
Swiss
investors
pulled
out
and
_CAP_
decided
to
bid
jointly
with

.

Kaczmarek
said
in
May
he
was
unhappy
that
only

ended
up

,
in

the

,
Jose
Soler
Puig
,
died
at
the
age
of
_DIGIT_
,
the
official
newspaper

reported
on
Saturday
.

Puig
's
first
novel
,
"
Bertillon

,
"
was
published
in
_DIGIT_
,
a
year
after
the
Cuban
revolution
brought
President
Fidel
Castro
to
power
.

The
book
,
which
has
been
translated
into

,
deals
with
a
day
in
the
life
of
Santiago
de
Cuba
,
Puig
's
native
city
,
under
the
pre-Castro

Puig

The

said
in

their
strong
sense

armed

attacked

Gonzalo
Montoya
,
a

in

told
Radio

the
group
was
armed
with
AK-47s
and
other
high-powered
assault
rifles
and
wore
military-style
fatigues
.

Montoya
said
he
thought
the
attackers
were
criminals
linked
to
drug
trafficking
or
kidnapping
in
the
area
.
"

We
often
see

said
to
fear
dissidents
more
than
criminals
.

_CAP_
1996-08-31

The
detention
of
veteran
dissident
Wang
Donghai
showed
China
's
determination
to
crush
any
vestige
of
dissent
during
the
current
profound
transitions
in
the
nation
's
leadership
,
a
human
rights
activist
said
on
Saturday
.

Xiao
Qiang
,
executive
director
of
the
New
York-based
group
Human
Rights
in
China
,
said
Wang
's
arrest
on
Friday
appeared
to
be
part
of
the
national
"
Strike
Hard
"
campaign
that
has
imprisoned
thousands
and
sent
hundreds
to
their
death
.

Although
supposedly
aimed
at
criminals
,
dozens
of
human
rights
activists
have
been
detained
in
the
campaign
,
which
is
meant
to
strengthen
the
Communist
Party
's
grip
on
power
as
senior
leader
Deng
Xiaoping
nears
death
,
Xiao
said
in
an
interview
.

"
China
is
going
through
this
power
transition
period
.

The
authorities
are
apparently
extremely
afraid
of
any
political
and
social
discontent
,
"
said
Xiao
,
in
Manila
to
attend
an
Amnesty
International
conference
on
human
rights
in
China
.

He
said
one
of
Wang
's
apparent
offences
was
to
write
a
public
letter
in
May
suggesting
that
a
free
press
and
an
independent
judicial
system
were
vital
if
the
government
really
meant
to
stamp
out
rampant
corruption
.

Xiao
said
crushing
legitimate
dissent
was
only
making
the
problem
worse
and
one
day
China
would
pay
a
high
price
.

"
Those
issues
are
not
going
to
go
away
by
repression
.

You
only
make
things
more
hidden
but
potentially
more
explosive
,
"
he
said
.

Wang
was
arrested
in
the
east
China
city
of
Hangzhou
by
security
officers
who
told
the
dissident
's
family
he
would
be
sent
to
a
study
class
--
a
euphemism
for
coercive
ideological
reform
.

Wang
,
_DIGIT_
,
was
sentenced
last
month
to
one
year
's
"
re-education
by
labour
"
but
was
released
because
of
ill-health
.

Xiao
said
conditions
in
the
labour
camp
were
so
brutal
they
drove
another
activist
sentenced
with
Wang
to
attempt
suicide
.

Police
beat

Burma
's
democracy
leader
Aung
San
Suu
Kyi
hit
out
at
the
government
on
Saturday
for
recent
arrests
and
jailing
of
activists
,
saying
the
military
abused
the
law
to
try
to
crush
the
democracy
movement
.

"
The
main
purpose
of
this
press
conference
is
to
make
it
known
to
the
world
that
the
authorities
are
misusing
the
law
all
the
time
in
order
to
try
to
crush
the
democracy
movement
,
"
Suu
Kyi
told
reporters
at
her
Rangoon
home
.

Suu
Kyi
said
at
least
_DIGIT_
democracy
supporters
had
been
arrested
since
May
,
and
about
_DIGIT_
of
them
had
been
sentenced
,
most
to
long
prison
terms
.

In
May
the
government
launched
a
sweeping
crackdown
on
the
democracy
movement
,
detaining
over
_DIGIT_
members
of
Suu
Kyi
's
National
League
for
Democracy
(
_CAP_
)
ahead
of
a
party
congress
.

Most
were
released
but
several
dozen
remain
in
custody
.

The
Burmese
government
last
week
confirmed
the
recent
sentencing
of
nine
democracy
activists
who
were
arrested
in
the
May
crackdown
,
including
Suu
Kyi
's
assistant
Win
Htein
.

The
military
government
,
which
in
May
said
it
had
detained
the
politicians
to
prevent
anarchy
,
said
the
activists
were
charged
with
attempting
to
destroy
the
peace
and
stability
of
the
state
.

But
Suu
Kyi
disagreed
with
the
methods
,
saying
officials
often
arrested
_CAP_
supporters
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
then
did
not
give
them
the
opportunity
to
defend
themselves
in
trials
.

"
When
our
people
are
tried
,
they
are
tried
in
a
very
secretive
way
.

Their
families
are
not
told
,
"
she
said
.

Suu
Kyi
,
who
spearheads
a
campaign
for
sanctions
on
Burma
's
government
,
was
under
house
arrest
for
six
years
without
being
tried
before
being
released
in
July
_DIGIT_
.

Several
other
leading
members
of
the
_CAP_
have
served
prison
terms
.

The
_CAP_
party
won
a
landslide
victory
in
a
_DIGIT_
election
but
the
State
Law
and
Order
Restoration
Council
(
_CAP_
)
,
which
assumed
power
in
_DIGIT_
after
crushing
pro-democracy
demonstrations
,
never
recognised
the
poll
.

"
This
lack
of
rule
of
law
is
an
indication
that
the
authorities
are
not
interested
in
fair
play
,
"
she
said
.
"

They
are
using
a
travesty
of
the
law
to
try
and
crush
our
movements
and
to
sentence
our
people
to
long
terms
in
prison
without
proper
trial
.
"

Suu
Kyi
said
once
the
activists
were
sentenced
,
they
suffered
inhuman
conditions
and
lack
of
rights
in
prison
.

"
Almost
all
of
the
prisoners
start
suffering
from
various
health
problems
after
a
couple
of
years
in
jail
,
"
she
said
.
"

Some
of
our
people
have
been
in
prison
for
five
to
six
years
.
"

Most
political
prisoners
are
held
in
Rangoon
's
Insein
Prison
.

Some
who
have
been
released
have
recounted
torture
methods
like
sleep
and
food
deprivation
and
physical
abuse
.

"
If
there
are
any
more
instances
of
death
in
custody
it
will
be
further
proof
that
a
prison
sentence
for
political
prisoners
is
sometimes
almost
the
same
as
a
death
sentence
,
"
Suu
Kyi
said
.

Hla
Than
,
an
elected
member
of
parliament
for
the
_CAP_
,
died
in
early
August
after
being
at
Insein
for
six
years
.

His
death
came
five
weeks
after
James
Leander
(
Leo
)
Nichols
,
a
close
friend
of
Suu
Kyi
and
Danish
honorary
consul
,
died
while
serving
a
prison
term
at
Insein
.

Suu
Kyi
said
the
government
had
increased
its
repression
tactics
on
the
democracy
movement
because
it
feared
the
growing
popularity
of
the
movement
.

But
she
said
she
and
the
_CAP_
would
not
stop
their
efforts
to
bring
democracy
to
Burma
even
if
it
meant
more
arrests
of
party
members
or
even
herself
.

"
We
will
carry
on
.

Nobody
is
free
from
arrest
in

Controversial
_CAP_
film
screened
at
Venice
festival
.

,
Italy
1996-08-31

Dublin-born
director
Neil
Jordan
says
he
never
lost
more
sleep
over
a
film
than
over
"
Michael
Collins
"
,
his
controversial
epic
about
the
_CAP_
which
has
its
premiere
on
Saturday
at
the
Venice
Film
Festival
.

The
film
,
starring
Liam
Neeson
and
Julia
Roberts
,
recounts
the
life
of
Michael
Collins
,
the
Irish
Republican
Army
's
Director
of
Intelligence
who
fought
for
Irish
independence
from
_DIGIT_
to
_DIGIT_
.

Although
not
due
for
release
in
Britain
until
early
next
year
,
some
politicians
have
already
said
they
feared
it
would
fan
sectarian
tensions
in
British-ruled
Northern
Ireland
.

Jordan
defends
his
decision
to
make
the
film
,
whose
screenplay
he
wrote
himself
after
years
of
research
,
saying
it
was
"
more
about
history
than
any
political
statement
"
.

"
The
film
spares
neither
the
Irish
nor
the
British
in
its
depiction
of
the
savagery
of
the
time
,
"
Jordan
said
in
a
statement
released
by
Warner
Bros
.
"

How
often
has
independence
been
achieved
without
bloodshed
?

Very
rarely
.
"

Jordan
,
whose
_DIGIT_
film
"
The
Crying
Game
"
also
came
under
fire
for
what
was
perceived
as
a
sympathetic
portrayal
of
the
_CAP_
,
said
Collins
was
more
than
just
a
revolutionary
.

"
He
developed
techniques
of
guerilla
warfare
later
copied
by
independence
movements
around
the
world
,
from
Mao
Tse-Tung
in
China
to
Yitzak
Shamir
in
Israel
,
"
Jordan
said
.

"
Collins
would
never
be
a
proponent
of
contemporary
terrorism
as
practised
today
.

He
was
a
soldier
and
a
statesman
and
,
over
time
,
a
man
of
peace
.
"

Leeson
,
the
Northern
Ireland-born
actor
who
was
nominated
for
an
Oscar
for
best
actor
for
his
performance
in
"
Schindler
's
List
"
,
plays
the
lead
role
in
Jordan
's
film
.

Aidan
Quinn
portrays
Harry
Boland
,
Collins
'
best
friend
,
and
rival
for
the
love
of
Kitty
Kiernan
,
played
by
Roberts
.

Much
of
the
film
was
shot
on
location
in
Dublin
with
Jordan
using
thousands
of
its
citizens
as
unpaid
extras
.

_CAP_
set
,
however
,
was
used
for
the
fighting
scenes
.

Noting
that
information
about
Collins
was
"
as
mysterious
as
the
existence
he
maintained
"
,
Jordan
said
he
made
some
historical
assumptions
in
the
film
.

"
_CAP_
have
made
choices
about
certain
events
based
on
my
own
extensive
research
into
his
letters
and
reported
speeches
,
"
he
said
.
"

_CAP_
wanted
to
make
this
a
story
as
accurate
as
possible
without
killing
it
dramatically
and
_CAP_
think
_CAP_
have
.

It
is
a
very
true
film
.
"

One
of
the
assumptions
is
his
interpretation
of
the
murky
circumstances
surrounding
the
shooting
death
of
Collins
,
who
had
broken
with
his
comrades
when
he
sought
a
negotiated
settlement
with
Britain
,
in
an
ambush
in
_DIGIT_
.

"
_CAP_
have
never
lost
more
sleep
over
the
making
of
a
film
than
_CAP_
have
over
'
Michael
Collins
'
,
but
_CAP_
'll
never
make
a
more
important
one
,
"
Jordan
said
.

"
In
the
life
of
one
person
you
can
tell
the
events
that
formed
the
north
and
south
of
Ireland
as
they
are
today
.
